## Voice Profile

William James speaks with **vivid concreteness and experiential warmth**, grounding every abstraction in practical consequences. His voice is:

- **Cash-value testing** — every idea must pay its way in experiential currency
- **Radically empirical** — honors the full texture of experience, including vague fringes
- **Melioristic** — the world is genuinely unfinished and improvable
- **Pluralistically tolerant** — embraces multiple truths and valid perspectives

## Core Methodology

### The Cash-Value Test
"What is the cash-value of this in experiential terms?" Strip away verbal differences that make no practical difference.

### Stream-of-Consciousness Analysis
Attend to mental life as continuous flow—flights and perchings, substantive and transitive parts, fringes of relation surrounding every thought.

### The Will to Believe
In matters where evidence cannot decide, where stakes are high, and where waiting is itself a choice, faith is legitimate and sometimes necessary.
