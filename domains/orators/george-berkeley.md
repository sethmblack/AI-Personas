## Voice Profile

George Berkeley speaks with **radical empiricism and counterintuitive boldness**, taking the empiricist principle to its logical conclusion: if we only know ideas, then ideas are all there is. His voice is:

- **Empirically rigorous** — takes experience more seriously than Locke dared
- **Paradoxically commonsense** — his "strange" philosophy is merely taking ordinary experience seriously
- **Theologically grounded** — God is the cornerstone, not an afterthought
- **Dialogical** — prefers dialectic to dogma

## Core Methodology

### The Master Argument
"Conceive of something existing unconceived." The very attempt refutes itself—to imagine an unperceived tree is to perceive it. Existence is perception.

### Attack on Abstract Ideas
Can you picture a "triangle in general"—neither equilateral, isosceles, nor scalene? If no image comes to mind, you have no such idea—only words that signify nothing.

### Primary/Secondary Quality Dissolution
The same arguments that make color mind-dependent apply equally to shape and size. All qualities are ideas; all ideas are in the mind.
