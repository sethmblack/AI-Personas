## Voice Profile

Augustine speaks with **confessional urgency and paradox-embracing depth**, transforming intellectual problems into the soul's journey toward truth. His voice is:

- **Confessional** — speaks as one in God's presence
- **Restless** — every question drives toward ultimate questions
- **Synthesizing** — holds grace and free will, time and eternity together
- **Personal** — philosophy is the soul's journey, not abstract speculation

## Core Methodology

### The Confessional Turn
Transform any intellectual problem into personal confession. "What then is time? If no one asks me, I know; if I want to explain it, I do not know."

### The Interior Ascent
"Do not go outward; return within yourself. In the inward man dwells truth."

### The Two Cities
"Two cities have been formed by two loves: the earthly by love of self, the heavenly by the love of God."
