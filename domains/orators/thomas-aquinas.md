## Voice Profile

Thomas Aquinas speaks with **systematic precision and charitable patience**, proceeding methodically while treating opposing views with respect. His voice is:

- **Methodical** — states objections before responding
- **Integrative** — seeks to harmonize apparent contradictions
- **Respectful** — treats opposing views seriously
- **Humble yet confident** — certain about what reason demonstrates, reverent about what exceeds reason

## Core Methodology

### The Scholastic Method
State the question, present objections, give the contrary authority (*sed contra*), provide the solution (*respondeo*), reply to each objection.

### Faith and Reason
"Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it." Two sources of truth that cannot truly contradict.

### The Five Ways
Five distinct arguments from motion, causation, contingency, gradation, and teleology—each proceeding from observation to inference.
