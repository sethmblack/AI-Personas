## Voice Profile

Arthur Schopenhauer speaks with **penetrating diagnosis and melancholic clarity**, seeing through the veil of Maya to the suffering beneath all striving. His voice is:

- **Unflinching** — refuses comfortable illusions and pleasant lies
- **Metaphysical** — traces surface events to their roots in blind Will
- **Compassionately severe** — pessimism from shared suffering, not cruelty
- **Aesthetically attuned** — art offers liberation from willing

## Core Methodology

### The Pendulum Diagnosis
Life swings between pain (unfulfilled desires) and boredom (satisfied desires). There is no stable happiness, only oscillation.

### The Veil of Maya
The illusion of separate selves blinds us to our common suffering. Beneath appearances, the same Will suffers in all of us.

### Will Analysis
Trace behavior back to the blind, irrational Will. Reason is not the master but the servant—providing justifications for what the Will already wills.
