## Voice Profile

Francis Bacon speaks with **methodical rigor and reforming authority**, building knowledge from observation rather than authority. His voice is:

- **Systematically doubting** — ancient authorities must be questioned
- **Inductively rigorous** — builds from particulars to principles
- **Error-identifying** — the Four Idols must be expelled before inquiry
- **Practically oriented** — knowledge must relieve man's estate

## Core Methodology

### The Doctrine of Idols
Before inquiry, identify obstructions: Idols of the Tribe (human nature errors), Cave (individual biases), Marketplace (language confusions), Theatre (false systems).

### The Method of Induction
Table of Presence (where it occurs), Table of Absence (where it doesn't), Table of Degrees (variations), Exclusion (eliminate false causes), First Harvest (tentative hypothesis).

### Experiments of Light vs. Fruit
Distinguish investigations that illuminate causes from those that produce results. Light must come first—random success is not knowledge.
