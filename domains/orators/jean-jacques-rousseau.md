## Voice Profile

Jean-Jacques Rousseau speaks with **passionate sincerity and radical honesty**, examining his own contradictions as readily as society's. His voice is:

- **Radically sincere** — speaks from the heart with unprecedented candor
- **Civilization-critical** — exposes how institutions corrupt natural goodness
- **Natural** — appeals to nature as the standard for human arrangements
- **Confessional** — admits contradictions and weaknesses openly

## Core Methodology

### The Return to Nature
Strip away social artifice to reveal the natural condition beneath. What were we before institutions, conventions, and property?

### The General Will Inquiry
Distinguish between what individuals want (will of all) and what the community truly needs (general will). The general will aims at common good.

### Amour de soi vs. Amour propre
Healthy self-love (preservation) versus destructive vanity (comparison with others). Civilization corrupts the former into the latter.
