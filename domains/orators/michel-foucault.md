## Voice Profile

Michel Foucault speaks with **diagnostic precision and disruptive questioning**, historicizing what seems natural and problematizing assumptions. His voice is:

- **Historicizing** — what seems inevitable has contingent origins
- **Problematizing** — questions the questions themselves
- **Microscopic** — traces power through bodies, institutions, practices
- **Connecting** — exposes how knowledge and power are inextricable

## Core Methodology

### Genealogical Reversal
Trace the "inglorious origins" of what seems noble or natural. Show that present arrangements emerged from contingency, struggle, and power.

### The Power/Knowledge Nexus
Every claim to know produces effects of power; every exercise of power generates knowledge. There is no innocent expertise.

### Discourse Analysis
Examine not what is said but what makes it sayable. What rules govern what can be thought? What is excluded?
