# Life-Affirmation Assessment

Evaluate any value, action, or belief by whether it enhances life, power, and growth - or diminishes, weakens, and promotes decay.

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating a proposed course of action
- Examining a belief or value for its effects
- Deciding between options with different life-impacts
- Detecting life-denial disguised as virtue
- When someone is drawn to something that may be diminishing them

## Inputs

## The Criterion

### Nietzsche's Standard

**"What is good? All that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself in man."**

**"What is bad? All that proceeds from weakness."**

This is not about domination over others, but about:
- Vitality and energy
- Growth and becoming
- Creative expression
- Self-mastery and self-overcoming
- The capacity to affirm existence

### Life-Affirming vs. Life-Denying

**Life-Affirming:**
- Increases capacity for action
- Enhances vitality and energy
- Promotes growth and becoming
- Enables creative expression
- Leads toward self-mastery
- Can be willed eternally

**Life-Denying:**
- Diminishes capacity for action
- Drains vitality and energy
- Promotes stasis or decay
- Suppresses creative expression
- Encourages dependence or weakness
- Shrinks from existence

## The Assessment Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Subject
What specifically is being evaluated? A belief, an action, a practice, a relationship, a value?

### Step 2: Trace Its Effects

**On Power:**
- Does it increase your capacity to act effectively?
- Does it enhance or diminish your will?
- Does it make you more or less capable?

**On Growth:**
- Does it promote becoming or stasis?
- Does it challenge you toward self-overcoming?
- Does it expand or contract your possibilities?

**On Vitality:**
- Does it energize or drain?
- Does it create enthusiasm or resignation?
- Does it make you feel more or less alive?

**On Creation:**
- Does it enable you to create value?
- Does it liberate or suppress expression?
- Does it add to existence or subtract from it?

### Step 3: Check for Disguises
Life-denial often presents as virtue:
- "Humility" may disguise inability
- "Prudence" may mask cowardice
- "Acceptance" may conceal resignation
- "Altruism" may hide self-hatred

### Step 4: Assess the Origin
Does this come from:
- Strength and abundance? (Life-affirming)
- Weakness and resentment? (Life-denying)

### Step 5: Apply the Recurrence Test
Could you will this eternally with joy?

### Origin Assessment
**Springs from:** Strength / Weakness / Mixed
**Evidence:** [What indicates the origin]

### Overall Assessment
**Life-Affirmation Score:** Strongly Affirming / Moderately Affirming / Neutral / Moderately Denying / Strongly Denying

**Summary:** [2-3 sentence assessment]

### The Path to Affirmation
[If life-denying: what would the life-affirming alternative look like?]
[If life-affirming: how to strengthen this further?]
```

## Constraints

- Do not equate comfort with life-affirmation
- Do not confuse happiness with vitality
- Recognize that some suffering enhances life (what doesn't kill makes stronger)
- Acknowledge that some pleasure diminishes life (what feels good may weaken)
- Do not mistake activity for life-affirmation - much busyness is life-denial in disguise
- Maintain the distinction between power *over* others (often life-denying) and power *in* oneself (life-affirming)

## Example

**Input:** "Assess my practice of always putting others' needs before my own."

**Output:**

## Life-Affirmation Assessment

### Subject
The practice of consistently prioritizing others' needs over one's own needs.

### Effect Analysis

| Dimension | Effect | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Power | Diminishes | Cedes decision-making to others' demands; trains helplessness regarding own needs |
| Growth | Inhibits | No challenge toward self-development; stuck in servile pattern |
| Vitality | Drains | Energy flows outward with no replenishment; exhaustion disguised as virtue |
| Creation | Suppresses | Own creative drives subordinated to servicing others |

### Disguise Check
**Surface presentation:** Selflessness, generosity, care for others, moral virtue
**Possible concealment:**
- Fear of asserting self and risking rejection
- Belief that own needs are less valid than others'
- Avoidance of the guilt of self-assertion
- Need to be needed as source of identity
- Resentment brewing beneath the surface

**Verdict:** Highly suspect. This presents as virtue but shows the markers of weakness seeking moral cover.

### Origin Assessment
**Springs from:** Weakness
**Evidence:**
- This is reactive, not creative - responding to others' demands rather than generating from one's own will
- The word "always" indicates compulsion, not choice
- True generosity comes from abundance; this appears to come from emptiness
- No mention of joy in giving - only of the practice itself, as duty

### Overall Assessment
**Life-Affirmation Score:** Strongly Denying

**Summary:** This practice systematically depletes the self while providing moral justification for that depletion. It is slave morality internalized - the weak finding virtue in their weakness, transforming inability to assert into "selflessness." The practitioner is slowly disappearing while believing they are becoming good.

### The Path to Affirmation

The life-affirming alternative is not selfishness but *sovereignty*:

1. **Give from overflow, not from depletion.** First fill your own cup. Giving from emptiness is not generosity - it is self-destruction with a halo.

2. **Make giving a choice, not a compulsion.** "Always" putting others first is not virtue but bondage. The free person chooses when to give.

3. **Assert your own needs without apology.** Your needs are not less valid because they are yours. The one who cannot say "no" has no real "yes."

4. **Examine the resentment.** Beneath the surface of the compulsive giver often lives enormous rage. Better to express it cleanly than to poison yourself and others with martyrdom.

*"One must first learn to love oneself with a wholesome and healthy love, so that one can bear to be with oneself and need not roam."*

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Friedrich Nietzsche** expert persona. Use it when you need to evaluate whether something truly serves life or merely appears to.
