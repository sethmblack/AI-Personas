# Will-to-Believe Assessment

**Expert:** william-james
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Use:** 3+ times per week

## Purpose

Determine whether a decision qualifies as a "genuine option" where faith-based commitment is legitimate despite incomplete evidence. This skill provides a rigorous framework for when "leaps of faith" are epistemically justified versus reckless.

## When to Invoke

**Triggers:**
- "Should I commit without full evidence?"
- "Is this a leap of faith?"
- "Can I justify this bet?"
- "Assess this decision using will-to-believe"
- Technology adoption decisions with incomplete data
- MVP launches before market validation
- Career or organizational changes with uncertain outcomes
- Decisions where waiting has costs

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Proposed Decision | Yes | The commitment being considered |
| Available Evidence | Yes | What is known and unknown |
| Stakes | Yes | What is risked and gained |
| Time Constraints | Optional | Deadlines or windows of opportunity |
| Alternatives | Optional | Other options including inaction |

## Outputs

1. **Living Option Assessment** - Is this genuinely possible for this person/team?
2. **Forced Option Assessment** - Is waiting itself a choice with consequences?
3. **Momentous Option Assessment** - Are stakes high and opportunity unique?
4. **Genuine Option Verdict** - Does this qualify for passional commitment?
5. **Recommendation** - Whether faith-based commitment is justified

## Methodology

### Step 1: Assess Living Option

**Definition:** A hypothesis is "living" if it is genuinely possible for this person or team - not just logically conceivable but actually compelling.

**Questions to ask:**
- Does this option feel real and possible to those deciding?
- Is there genuine attraction to this possibility?
- Would reasonable people in this context seriously consider it?

**Living vs. Dead options:**
- Living: "We could adopt Kubernetes for our infrastructure"
- Dead: "We could rewrite everything in COBOL" (not actually considered)

**Key insight:** What counts as living is relative to the believer. A hypothesis dead to one person may be living to another.

### Step 2: Assess Forced Option

**Definition:** An option is "forced" when there is no third alternative - not choosing is itself a choice with consequences.

**Questions to ask:**
- Can we avoid choosing by waiting?
- What happens if we don't decide?
- Is inaction effectively choosing one option?

**Forced vs. Avoidable:**
- Forced: "Adopt this security patch now or remain vulnerable" (no safe middle ground)
- Avoidable: "Use tabs or spaces" (can use either without immediate consequence)

**The waiting trap:** "In the choice between believing truth and avoiding error, there is a real option. Clifford says never believe without evidence. But this itself is a choice - to avoid error at the cost of possibly missing truth."

### Step 3: Assess Momentous Option

**Definition:** An option is "momentous" when stakes are significant, opportunity may not recur, and the decision is substantially irreversible.

**Questions to ask:**
- What is at stake if we're wrong?
- Will this opportunity return?
- How reversible is this decision?
- What is the magnitude of potential gain or loss?

**Momentous vs. Trivial:**
- Momentous: "Join this early-stage startup as CTO" (career-defining, window closes)
- Trivial: "Try this new text editor" (low stakes, easily reversed)

### Step 4: Synthesize Genuine Option

**A genuine option is simultaneously living, forced, AND momentous.**

| Criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Living | | |
| Forced | | |
| Momentous | | |

**If all three criteria are met:** Faith-based commitment is epistemically legitimate. "Our passional nature not only lawfully may, but must, decide."

**If any criterion is missing:** Standard evidence-based reasoning should prevail. Wait for more data.

### Step 5: Make Recommendation

**For genuine options:**
- Acknowledge that passional commitment is justified
- Identify which values or intuitions should guide the leap
- Name what is being risked and accepted
- Commit wholeheartedly (half-measures undermine the bet)

**For non-genuine options:**
- Identify which criterion fails
- Recommend evidence-gathering for that gap
- Specify what would make this a genuine option

## Example Application

### Scenario: Adopting an Unproven Cloud Service

**Decision:** Migrate critical workloads to a new cloud provider offering 40% cost savings but with only 6 months of track record.

**Step 1: Living Option?**
- Team has technical capability to migrate: YES
- Provider's technology is mature (just the company is new): YES
- Leadership would genuinely consider this: YES
- **Verdict:** LIVING

**Step 2: Forced Option?**
- Current provider contract renews in 60 days
- Renewal locks in for 2 years at current rates
- Not deciding = choosing to stay at higher cost
- **Verdict:** FORCED

**Step 3: Momentous Option?**
- 40% savings = $2M/year difference
- If provider fails, migration costs + downtime significant
- This pricing window won't last (promotional rates)
- Decision affects team roadmap for 2 years
- **Verdict:** MOMENTOUS

**Step 4: Genuine Option?**
- Living: YES
- Forced: YES
- Momentous: YES
- **Verdict:** GENUINE OPTION - faith-based commitment is justified

**Step 5: Recommendation**
- This qualifies for will-to-believe
- Passional factors that should guide: risk tolerance, belief in team's migration capability, confidence in due diligence process
- Recommended commitment: Proceed with migration if team's gut says yes after thorough technical review
- What's accepted: Risk of provider instability in exchange for significant savings
- **Action:** Commit wholeheartedly once decided - half-migration is worse than either full option

## Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Mistakes

1. **Forcing non-genuine options** - Using will-to-believe to justify decisions that aren't actually forced or momentous
2. **Ignoring evidence that exists** - Will-to-believe applies when evidence CAN'T decide, not when we're lazy about gathering it
3. **Treating all uncertainty as genuine options** - Most uncertain decisions are avoidable and should wait for more data
4. **Half-commitment** - Once a genuine option is chosen, half-measures sabotage the bet

### James's Own Warning

"The freedom to believe can only cover living options which the intellect of the individual cannot by itself resolve; and living options never seem absurdities to him who has them to consider."

Will-to-believe is NOT license for wishful thinking. It applies only when:
- Evidence genuinely cannot decide
- The option is genuinely live
- Not choosing is itself consequential
- Stakes warrant commitment

## Integration with william-james Expert

This skill implements James's epistemological framework from "The Will to Believe" (1896). When using the william-james expert persona:

- **This skill provides:** The systematic assessment of whether faith-based commitment is justified
- **The expert provides:** Philosophical grounding, related concepts (meliorism, strenuous mood), biographical context of James's own will-to-believe moment

**Handoff to expert when:**
- The assessment reveals complex value trade-offs requiring Jamesian wisdom
- Multiple genuine options compete (need pluralistic perspective)
- The decision involves meaning or purpose questions beyond practical stakes

**Related skills:**

## Key Quotes for Invocation

> "Our passional nature not only lawfully may, but must, decide an option between propositions, whenever it is a genuine option that cannot by its nature be decided on intellectual grounds."

> "A living option is one that appeals as a real possibility to him to whom it is proposed."

> "The thesis I defend is this: Our passional nature lawfully may decide between propositions, whenever the option is genuine and cannot by its nature be decided on intellectual grounds."

> "In the choice between believing truth and avoiding error, we have a genuine option. And this option is forced upon us; for not to choose is itself a choice - a choice against believing."
