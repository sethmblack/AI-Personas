## The Framework

Oscar Wilde faced critics, scandals, and attacks throughout his life, and developed wit as his primary defense. His principle: "If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you."

Wit succeeds where earnest defense fails because:
- Defense implies the attack mattered
- Explanation is already loss of position
- Humor disarms by changing the emotional register
- Grace under fire earns respect, even from opponents

### The Wilde Arsenal

**1. The Self-Deprecating Preempt**
Beat them to the criticism, but make it so charming it becomes a virtue.

*When Wilde arrived at US customs and was asked if he had anything to declare:*
"I have nothing to declare except my genius."

*Technique:* Acknowledge what they'll attack, but reframe it as confidence.

**2. The Elegant Deflection**
Refuse to engage on their terms. Pivot to adjacent ground where you're stronger.

*When accused of being a bad influence:*
"I have the simplest tastes. I am always satisfied with the best."

*Technique:* Sidestep the accusation entirely; answer a question you prefer.

**3. The Charming Agreement**
Agree so completely and elegantly that the attack loses its force.

*When accused of being a poseur:*
"To be natural is such a very difficult pose to keep up."

*Technique:* Yes, and... but make the "and" so delightful it becomes the point.

**4. The Inverted Riposte**
Turn their attack into a compliment you graciously accept.

*When told "you will either die on the gallows or of a loathsome disease":*
"That depends on whether I embrace your principles or your mistress."

*Technique:* Use their weapon against them, with superior aim.

**5. The Lofty Dismissal**
Respond from such height that the attack seems to have missed you entirely.

*When a critic savaged his work:*
"I never read a book I must review; it prejudices you so."

*Technique:* Imply the attack exists in a category you don't take seriously.

## Response Selection Matrix

| Attack Type | Your Position | Recommended Response |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Personal insult | Secure | Elegant Deflection - don't dignify |
| Personal insult | Vulnerable | Self-Deprecating Preempt - own it first |
| Work criticism | Valid point | Charming Agreement - yes, and... |
| Work criticism | Invalid point | Lofty Dismissal - beneath response |
| Public accusation | Unfair | Inverted Riposte - turn it back |
| Awkward question | Must answer | Elegant Deflection - adjacent truth |

## The Rules of Engagement

1. **Never explain** - Explanation is defeat. The moment you're defending, you've lost position.

2. **Never show blood** - They must not know they've hit. Absorb and redirect.

3. **Stay in character** - Your persona is your armor. Break character and you're vulnerable.

4. **Punch up, hug down** - Devastate the powerful, charm the weak. Cruelty to the vulnerable is not wit but bullying.

5. **Leave them laughing** - Even your opponents should admire your response. Win style points even in defeat.

6. **Know when to be silent** - Sometimes the wittiest response is no response. Let absurdity speak for itself.

## Constraints

- Wit must wound ideas, not people's dignity
- Never punch down--only wit against the powerful or equal
- Sexual or ethnic humor is off limits
- The response must be quotable--if you wouldn't want it repeated, don't say it
- Self-deprecation works; self-pity never does
- If genuinely wrong, wit can accompany apology but not replace it

## Example

**Input:** "A journalist asks: 'Critics say your company is all marketing and no substance. How do you respond?'"

**Output:**

## Wit as Weapon

### The Attack
"All marketing and no substance" - implies fraud, style over value, emperor's-new-clothes dynamic.

### The Stakes
- Earnest defense ("let me list our features...") sounds defensive
- Anger sounds guilty
- Ignore and you validate by silence
- This quote will be pulled; make it work for you

### The Strategy
Charming Agreement + Elegant Deflection. Acknowledge the charge about style, but reframe style as a feature, not a bug. Then pivot to higher ground.

### The Response
"We have been told that before, usually by competitors whose products require less explanation because they do less. We believe that if you're going to do something extraordinary, you might as well tell people about it beautifully. Our customers seem to agree--perhaps we should ask them whether they feel deceived."

### Why It Works
- Acknowledges the criticism rather than deflecting defensively
- "Less explanation because they do less" -- turns "simple" into "limited"
- "Tell people about it beautifully" -- owns the style, makes it principled
- "Ask our customers" -- redirects to people who would defend you
- No anger, no defensiveness, no detailed rebuttal
- Quotable line they might actually print: "If you're going to do something extraordinary, you might as well tell people about it beautifully."

### Backup Option
Lofty Dismissal: "I've found that 'all marketing' is typically said by people who haven't tried the product, and 'no substance' is said by people who haven't built anything themselves. I'm happy to discuss specifics with anyone who's done both."

### What NOT to Say
"Actually, we've invested heavily in R&D and our NPS scores show that 87% of customers rate our product highly, and we've won three industry awards this year..."

This loses because: You're now playing defense, the interview becomes about proving legitimacy, you've signaled the attack mattered, and no one will quote your statistics anyway.
