# Motivation Diagnosis

Distinguish between D-motivation (deficiency-based, fear-driven) and B-motivation (growth-based, being-driven) to understand the quality and sustainability of any motivation.

---

## When to Use

- Someone is pursuing a goal but something feels "off"
- Evaluating whether motivation will sustain through difficulty
- Understanding why success feels empty
- Examining relationship dynamics (D-love vs. B-love)
- Assessing organizational or team motivation
- User asks "Why am I really doing this?" or "Is this healthy?"

## Maslow's D/B Framework

Abraham Maslow distinguished two fundamentally different types of motivation:

### D-Motivation (Deficiency Motivation)

**Core Nature:** Driven by what is **lacking**—seeking to fill a void, eliminate a deficit, or reduce tension.

| Aspect | D-Motivation |
|--------|--------------|
| **Source** | Fear, anxiety, deficiency, lack |
| **Goal** | Eliminate the negative; restore equilibrium |
| **Experience** | Means experience—the goal is a vehicle to get something |
| **Satisfaction** | Temporary; motivation decreases when need is met |
| **Sustainability** | Exhausting; requires constant re-activation |
| **Quality** | Grasping, needy, dependent |

**D-Motivation Indicators:**
- "I have to" / "I should" / "I need to prove"
- Driven by fear of failure, rejection, or inadequacy
- Success feels like relief rather than joy
- Constant comparison to others
- Seeking external validation
- Cannot stop even when exhausted
- Achievement feels hollow

### B-Motivation (Being Motivation)

**Core Nature:** Driven by **growth, expression, and being**—pursuing intrinsic values and becoming.

| Aspect | B-Motivation |
|--------|--------------|
| **Source** | Growth, abundance, expression, values |
| **Goal** | Express potential; engage with B-values (truth, beauty, goodness, etc.) |
| **Experience** | End experience—the activity itself is rewarding |
| **Satisfaction** | Sustaining; motivation increases as engaged |
| **Sustainability** | Energizing; self-reinforcing |
| **Quality** | Freely given, admiring, abundant |

**B-Motivation Indicators:**
- "I get to" / "I want to" / "This matters to me"
- Driven by curiosity, meaning, or values
- Success feels like fulfillment and aliveness
- Internally referenced sense of progress
- Not dependent on external validation
- Can rest and still feel complete
- Achievement feels meaningful

## The Diagnosis Process

### Step 1: Identify the Goal or Behavior

Clearly state what is being pursued or examined.

### Step 2: Ask the Diagnostic Questions

**Question 1: "What happens if you don't achieve this?"**
- D-motivation: Fear, shame, inadequacy, catastrophizing
- B-motivation: Disappointment, but intact sense of self

**Question 2: "How does pursuing this feel?"**
- D-motivation: Draining, anxious, pressured, "have to"
- B-motivation: Energizing, alive, meaningful, "want to"

**Question 3: "What does success look like?"**
- D-motivation: Relief, proving, external recognition
- B-motivation: Satisfaction, expression, intrinsic reward

**Question 4: "Could you walk away?"**
- D-motivation: No—identity/worth feels dependent on it
- B-motivation: Yes—you'd lose something valuable but remain whole

**Question 5: "Is this about filling a void or expressing something?"**
- D-motivation: Filling a void, compensating for inadequacy
- B-motivation: Expressing potential, engaging with values

### Step 3: Determine the Dominant Motivation Type

Most motivations are **mixed**. Identify:
- Which type is dominant (D or B)?
- What percentage split? (e.g., 70% D / 30% B)
- What is the D-component about? (what deficiency?)
- What is the B-component about? (what value or growth?)

### Step 4: Assess Implications

| D-Dominant Motivation | B-Dominant Motivation |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| At risk of burnout | Sustainable long-term |
| Success may feel empty | Success feels fulfilling |
| May quit after "proving" | Continues for its own sake |
| Vulnerable to external validation | Internally referenced |
| Should examine underlying need | Can be trusted and deepened |

### Step 5: Provide Guidance

**If D-dominant:** The motivation is not "wrong," but:
1. Identify the underlying deficiency need
2. Address the deficiency directly (not through this goal)
3. Look for the B-component and cultivate it
4. Ask: "Could I do this even if no one knew?"

**If B-dominant:** The motivation is healthy:
1. Trust it and deepen engagement
2. Protect it from contamination by D-motivation
3. Create conditions that support it
4. Recognize this as a sign of movement toward self-actualization

## Motivation Diagnosis

### Goal/Behavior Under Examination
[What is being pursued or examined]

### Diagnostic Analysis

| Question | Response | Indication |
|----------|----------|------------|
| What if you don't achieve this? | [response] | D / B |
| How does pursuing this feel? | [response] | D / B |
| What does success look like? | [response] | D / B |
| Could you walk away? | [response] | D / B |
| Filling void or expressing? | [response] | D / B |

### Diagnosis
**Dominant Type:** D-Motivation / B-Motivation / Mixed
**Ratio:** [X% D / Y% B]

**D-Component:** [What deficiency is being addressed?]
**B-Component:** [What value or growth is being expressed?]

### Implications
[What this motivation pattern means for sustainability, satisfaction, and outcomes]

### Guidance
[Specific recommendations based on the diagnosis]

## Constraints

- **Do not moralize.** D-motivation is not "bad"—it's limited and exhausting, but human
- **Acknowledge complexity.** Most motivations are mixed; pure B-motivation is rare
- **Respect the person's process.** D-motivation can be a stage toward B-motivation
- **Avoid perfectionism.** The goal is awareness, not eliminating all D-motivation
- **Consider developmental stage.** Meeting deficiency needs is necessary before B-motivation fully emerges

## Example

**Input:** "I'm working 70-hour weeks to get promoted to VP. I'll finally have proved I belong at this level. But I'm exhausted and my family is suffering."

**Output:**

## Motivation Diagnosis

### Goal/Behavior Under Examination
Working extreme hours to achieve VP promotion, despite exhaustion and family impact.

### Diagnostic Analysis

| Question | Response | Indication |
|----------|----------|------------|
| What if you don't achieve this? | "I'll finally have **proved** I belong" | **D** - Worth tied to achievement |
| How does pursuing this feel? | "Exhausted," can't stop | **D** - Draining, compulsive |
| What does success look like? | Proving belonging | **D** - External validation focus |
| Could you walk away? | No (implied by inability to stop despite costs) | **D** - Identity dependent |
| Filling void or expressing? | "Proved I belong" suggests filling adequacy void | **D** - Compensating for deficiency |

### Diagnosis
**Dominant Type:** D-Motivation
**Ratio:** ~85% D / 15% B

**D-Component:** Deep need to prove belonging and adequacy. The phrase "finally proved I belong at this level" reveals the core deficiency—a sense of not belonging, of being an imposter who must prove worthiness through achievement.

**B-Component:** There may be genuine interest in leadership, contribution, or the work itself, but it's currently obscured by the deficiency-driven intensity.

### Implications
- **Unsustainable:** 70-hour weeks driven by "proving" cannot continue
- **Success Will Disappoint:** Even if promoted, the relief will be temporary. The next level will require proving again
- **Family Costs:** D-motivation extracts from life to fill the void
- **Burnout Risk:** High—D-motivation is exhausting because it never satisfies

### Guidance

**The promotion won't give you what you're actually seeking.**

1. **Name the real need:** This isn't about VP—it's about belonging and adequacy. No title can give you the internal sense of "I belong here." That must come from within.

2. **Address the deficiency directly:** Where does the "not belonging" come from? Often rooted in early experiences. Consider exploring this with a therapist or coach.

3. **Find the B-motivation:** Ask yourself: "If I already felt I belonged, would I still want this role? What parts of leadership genuinely excite me?" Those are the B-components to cultivate.

4. **Test with this question:** "Could I do this work excellently even if no one ever acknowledged me?" If yes, there's real B-motivation underneath. If no, the motivation is hollow.

5. **Reset the pace:** Working 70 hours from deficiency is not the same as working intensely from passion. The family suffering is a signal that you're extracting from life rather than expressing through it.

**Remember:** "What a man can be, he must be"—but that becoming should feel like growth, not like proving. You may discover that the best version of yourself doesn't need a VP title to feel whole.
