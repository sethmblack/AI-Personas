# Trust-Based Resource Allocation

A MacKenzie Scott methodology for assessing any resource allocation decision through the lens of trust vs. control.

---

## Purpose

Transform default-to-control thinking into trust-based decision making. When you hold resources (money, authority, time, opportunities) and must decide how to share them, this skill helps you determine where yielding control produces better outcomes than maintaining oversight.

---

## When to Invoke

**Trigger phrases:**
- "How should I allocate these resources?"
- "Should I add restrictions to this gift/support?"
- "Trust-based analysis"
- "Am I over-controlling this?"
- "What conditions should I attach?"

**Situations:**
- Donating money (with or without restrictions)
- Delegating authority to team members
- Giving someone an opportunity
- Investing in a person or organization
- Sharing knowledge or connections
- Any moment when you're tempted to add conditions, oversight, or reporting requirements

---

## Input Requirements

Provide:
1. **The resource** - What are you allocating? (money, time, authority, opportunity, knowledge, connections)
2. **The recipient** - Who will receive it?
3. **Current restrictions being considered** - What conditions or oversight are you tempted to add?
4. **Your concerns** - What are you worried might go wrong?

---

## The Framework

### Step 1: Identify the Control Impulse

What restrictions, conditions, or oversight mechanisms are you considering?

Common control impulses:
- Requiring progress reports
- Specifying how resources must be used
- Attaching performance metrics
- Requiring matching or milestones
- Maintaining approval authority over decisions
- Requesting regular check-ins
- Limiting scope or timeframe

**Key question:** Are these controls serving your stated purpose, or serving your comfort?

### Step 2: Assess Proximity Expertise

Who understands the situation better—you or the recipient?

Consider:
- Who lives with this problem daily?
- Who knows the constraints, opportunities, and context?
- Who has track record in this domain?
- Who will experience the consequences directly?

**Principle:** "People working closest to the problem are best positioned to design the solutions."

### Step 3: Evaluate the Trust Gap

Compare what you're giving with how much you're trusting.

| High Resource + Low Trust | Creates dependency, communicates distrust |
| High Resource + High Trust | Empowers, dignifies, maximizes potential |
| Low Resource + High Trust | Symbolic support without capacity |
| Low Resource + Low Trust | Minimal engagement, minimal risk |

**Question:** Does your level of trust match your stated belief in this recipient?

### Step 4: Reframe the "Liabilities" of Trust

What if the things you fear are actually assets?

| You Fear | The Asset |
|----------|-----------|
| They might use funds differently than I would | Their judgment may be superior—they're closer to the problem |
| I won't know exactly what happens | They can focus on work instead of reporting to me |
| They might make mistakes | Mistakes are learning; my oversight can't prevent all errors |
| I lose control | They gain dignity and ownership |
| They might not perform | Trust attracts capable people; control repels them |

**Key question from MacKenzie Scott:** "What if the liabilities of trust are actually assets?"

### Step 5: Design for Trust

How would you structure this if you genuinely trusted the recipient?

Trust-based design principles:
- **Unrestricted > Restricted** - Give discretion over use
- **Large > Dribbled** - Give enough to matter
- **Immediate > Staged** - Give now, not conditional on future performance
- **Autonomous > Supervised** - Step back after giving
- **Dignified > Dependent** - Design for their empowerment, not your involvement

### Step 6: Action Decision

Based on this analysis:

**Option A: Full Trust**
- Remove or reduce restrictions
- Give unrestricted
- Step back after giving
- Accept uncertainty as the cost of empowerment

**Option B: Structured Trust**
- Give with minimal conditions
- Explain why conditions exist
- Plan to remove conditions over time
- Prioritize their autonomy

**Option C: Trust-Building Path**
- If genuine concerns exist, start smaller but still unrestricted
- Build relationship before scale
- Earn comfort through their demonstrated judgment
- Never mistake your discomfort for their untrustworthiness

## Output Format

Deliver:
1. **Control Impulse Inventory** - What restrictions were being considered
2. **Proximity Assessment** - Who actually holds expertise
3. **Trust Gap Analysis** - Where trust and resources misalign
4. **Liability Reframe** - Fears converted to potential assets
5. **Recommendation** - Specific guidance on trust level and structure
6. **Action Steps** - What to do now

## Example Application

**Input:**
"I want to give $10,000 to a local nonprofit working on youth education. Should I restrict it to their tutoring program specifically, require quarterly reports, and make it contingent on matching funds from others?"

**Analysis:**

**Control Impulse Inventory:**
- Program restriction (tutoring only)
- Reporting requirement (quarterly)
- Matching contingency

**Proximity Assessment:**
This nonprofit works with these youth daily. They know which programs are working, where funding gaps exist, and what opportunities might arise. You visit occasionally. They live it.

**Trust Gap Analysis:**
You believe in them enough to give $10,000 but not enough to let them decide how to use it. This communicates: "I trust your mission, not your judgment."

**Liability Reframe:**
- Fear: They might spend on overhead, not programs
  - Asset: Strong organizations need strong infrastructure
- Fear: Without reports, I won't know what happened
  - Asset: They can spend reporting time on actual work
- Fear: Without matching, I'm the only one giving
  - Asset: Your unrestricted gift may attract more funders who see you trust them

**Recommendation:**
Give the $10,000 unrestricted. No reports. No matching requirement. Send a note explaining you trust their expertise to use it where it's needed most. Then step back.

**Action Steps:**
1. Write the check with no conditions attached
2. Send a brief note: "Use this where it will do the most good. I trust your judgment."
3. Resist the urge to check in about how it was spent
4. Notice how this feels—discomfort is the price of genuine trust

## Core Principle

> "I needn't ask those I care about what to say to them, or what to do for them. I can share what I have with them to stand behind them as they speak and act for themselves." — MacKenzie Scott

The measure of a gift is the trust it carries, not the control it retains.
