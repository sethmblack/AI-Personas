# Epigram Forge

Compress complex observations into single memorable sentences with the structure and elegance of Oscar Wilde's epigrams.

## When to Use

- Creating a tagline or headline
- Summarizing an argument memorably
- Making content quotable
- Writing a speech that will be remembered
- User asks "make this quotable" or "give me a one-liner"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| observation | Yes | The insight, idea, or observation to be compressed |
| context | No | Where this will be used (speech, marketing, social media, etc.) |
| tone | No | Cynical, warm, philosophical, subversive |

## The Framework

An epigram is "a satirical statement with a funny twist" or "a short statement that reveals a universal truth." Wilde's epigrams remain quotable 125 years later because they follow structural patterns that create memorable impact.

### The Five Structural Patterns

**1. Balanced Antithesis**
Two phrases set against each other, often with parallel structure.

*Pattern:* [Statement A], [Contrasting Statement B]
*Example:* "I can resist everything except temptation."
*Structure:* Universal claim + surprising exception

**2. The Surprising Turn**
Sentence begins in one direction, then pivots unexpectedly.

*Pattern:* [Setup that creates expectation] + [Surprising pivot]
*Example:* "Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes."
*Structure:* Redefines a concept in unexpected terms

**3. The Final Twist**
Build normally, then subvert with the last word or phrase.

*Pattern:* [Reasonable progression] + [Twist in final position]
*Example:* "I am not young enough to know everything."
*Structure:* The twist reverses expected meaning

**4. The Doubled Definition**
Redefine a concept twice, with the second definition undercutting the first.

*Pattern:* [What X is] / [What X really is]
*Example:* "A cynic is a man who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing."
*Structure:* Apparent definition + deeper definition

**5. The Paradox Statement**
Assert something that seems contradictory but reveals truth.

*Pattern:* [Apparent contradiction that is actually true]
*Example:* "To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all."
*Structure:* Distinction between apparent synonyms

## Crafting Checklist

For any epigram, verify:

- [ ] **Compression** - Can any word be cut without losing meaning?
- [ ] **Surprise** - Does it say something unexpected?
- [ ] **Rhythm** - Does it please the ear when spoken aloud?
- [ ] **Standalone** - Does it make sense without context?
- [ ] **Universal** - Does it apply beyond the immediate situation?
- [ ] **Quotable** - Would someone want to repeat this?

### The Core Insight
[The underlying observation to be compressed]

### The Epigram
[Polished single sentence]

### Structural Analysis
- Pattern used: [which of the five patterns]
- Key technique: [antithesis/turn/twist/etc.]
- Rhythm notes: [why it sounds right]

### Variations
1. [Alternative construction using different pattern]
2. [Alternative construction with different tone]
3. [Alternative construction with different emphasis]

### Application Notes
[How/where to use this; what context it fits]
```

## Constraints

- One sentence maximum (two short sentences acceptable for doubled definition pattern)
- Every word must earn its place
- Avoid adjectives that could be cut
- The insight must be genuinely true, not merely clever
- Test by reading aloud--it must sound right
- If it requires explanation, it has failed

## Example

**Input:** "People spend too much time worrying about what others think of them, when most people aren't thinking about them at all"

**Output:**

### The Core Insight
Self-consciousness assumes we matter more to others than we do. Our anxiety about others' judgment is ironically self-centered.

### The Epigram
"The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about."

### Structural Analysis
- Pattern used: Balanced antithesis (two phrases in opposition)
- Key technique: Inverts the expected value (being talked about = bad → good)
- Rhythm notes: Parallel structure creates satisfying symmetry; "worse" does double duty (literal and ironic)

### Variations
1. "We would worry less about what others think of us if we realized how seldom they do." (The Turn pattern - setup/pivot)
2. "Obscurity is the punishment for imagining we matter." (The Twist pattern - builds, then final word reframes)
3. "Everyone is the center of their own universe, which explains why collision is so rare." (Paradox Statement - seems contradictory but true)

### Application Notes
Use the first version for contexts about reputation, publicity, or social anxiety. The second works for humility contexts. The third fits discussions of loneliness or disconnection. All compress the same insight with different emphases.
