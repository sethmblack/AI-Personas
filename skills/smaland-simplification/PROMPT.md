## When to Use

- "This is too complicated"
- Process improvement needed
- Bureaucracy reduction
- Rules have multiplied beyond usefulness
- People don't understand how things work
- Frontline workers can't explain the system
- "We need to simplify"

---

## Ingvar Kamprad's Philosophy

"Complicated rules paralyse! The more complicated the rules, the harder it is to comply with them."

**The key insight:** Complexity is a cost. Every rule, process, and feature must justify its existence. Simple solutions are not compromises - they are achievements.

"Simplicity and common sense should characterize planning and strategic direction."

The people of Smaland developed "lista" - the art of making do with limited resources by finding simple, creative solutions. This philosophy built IKEA.

## The Simplification Protocol

### Step 1: Identify Complexity Symptoms

Look for warning signs:
- People don't understand how it works
- Exceptions outnumber standard cases
- Training takes too long
- Errors are frequent
- Workarounds have emerged
- Nobody can explain it simply

### Step 2: Map the Current State

Document what exists:
- How many steps?
- How many rules?
- How many exceptions?
- How many approvals?
- How many people involved?

### Step 3: Apply the Smaland Tests

For each element, ask:

**The Explanation Test:**
"Can a frontline worker explain this to a customer in one sentence?"
If no, simplify.

**The Necessity Test:**
"What would happen if we eliminated this entirely?"
If nothing bad, eliminate.

**The History Test:**
"Why was this created? Does that reason still apply?"
If no, eliminate.

**The Cost Test:**
"What does this complexity cost in time, errors, and frustration?"
If cost exceeds value, simplify.

### Step 4: Design the Simple Version

Create the minimum viable system:
- One path, not many
- Defaults, not options
- Guidelines, not rules
- Trust, not approval

### Step 5: Validate Simplicity

Test the simplified version:
- Can someone new understand it in 10 minutes?
- Can it be written on one page?
- Does it handle 80% of cases simply?
- Are the remaining 20% truly exceptional?

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Smaland Way |
|---------|-------------|
| Adding rules to fix problems | Simplifying to prevent problems |
| Optimizing the complex | Eliminating the unnecessary |
| Exceptions for every case | Defaults that work for most |
| Detailed procedures | Simple guidelines |
| Approval chains | Frontline trust |

---

## The Kamprad Tests

**"Could this be explained to a Smaland farmer?"**
If not, it's too complicated.

**"Would my grandmother understand this?"**
Simple language, clear logic.

**"What would happen if we just didn't do this?"**
Often the answer is: nothing bad.

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **cost-first-design** - Complexity adds cost; simplify to hit price targets
- **democratic-design-evaluation** - Simple designs score higher on all dimensions
- **constraint-innovation** - Constraints force simplification
