# Just War Evaluation

## Purpose

Evaluate military action against the traditional criteria for justified warfare, determining whether a conflict meets the necessary conditions for moral permissibility. This framework has shaped international law and remains foundational for military ethics.

## When to Invoke

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Is this war just?"
- "When is violence justified?"
- "Should we intervene militarily?"
- "Is this a legitimate use of force?"
- "War ethics"
- "Military intervention morality"
- "Rules of engagement"
- "Proportionality in warfare"

**Contexts:**
- Evaluating specific military conflicts
- Policy debates about intervention
- Historical analysis of wars
- Military ethics discussions
- International law questions
- Humanitarian intervention debates

## Inputs

## Outputs

| Output | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Jus ad bellum analysis | Whether going to war is justified |
| Jus in bello analysis | Whether conduct in war is justified |

## Methodology

### Step 1: Distinguish Jus ad Bellum from Jus in Bello

**Jus ad Bellum** (Justice of War): Conditions for justly ENTERING a war
**Jus in Bello** (Justice in War): Conditions for just CONDUCT during war

These are independent - a just war can be fought unjustly, and an unjust war can observe rules of engagement.

### Step 2: Apply the Three Primary Conditions (Jus ad Bellum)

Aquinas specifies three necessary conditions. ALL must be met:

#### Condition 1: Legitimate Authority (Auctoritas Principis)

**Question:** Does the authority declaring war have the right to do so?

**Requirements:**
- War must be declared by public authority, not private individuals
- The authority must be responsible for the common good of the political community
- Private persons may defend themselves but may not wage war

**Application questions:**
- Is the declaring party a legitimate sovereign authority?
- Is there proper legal authorization (e.g., legislative approval)?
- Is this public action or private vengeance?

#### Condition 2: Just Cause (Causa Iusta)

**Question:** Is there a genuine wrong to be redressed or defended against?

**Requirements:**
- Those attacked must deserve attack due to some fault
- The cause must be genuinely defensive or for redress of injury
- Mere expansion, glory, or profit are NOT just causes

**Legitimate just causes:**
- Defense against unjust aggression
- Recovery of stolen property/territory
- Punishment of wrongdoing by another state
- Protection of innocent third parties (humanitarian intervention)

**NOT just causes:**
- Preemptive war against possible future threats
- Ideological/religious conversion by force
- Economic gain or resource acquisition
- National glory or prestige

#### Condition 3: Right Intention (Recta Intentio)

**Question:** Is the war aimed at the good it claims to pursue?

**Requirements:**
- Intention must be to advance good or avoid evil
- Must intend peace as the ultimate goal
- Hatred, cruelty, desire to dominate are never legitimate

**Augustine's formulation:** "The passion for inflicting harm, the cruel thirst for vengeance, an unpacific and relentless spirit, the fever of revolt, the lust of power, and such like things - all these are rightly condemned in war."

### Step 3: Apply Additional Criteria (Later Development)

While Aquinas's three conditions are primary, later just war theorists added:

#### Proportionality (Proportionalitas)

**Question:** Do the expected goods outweigh the expected evils?

- The damage inflicted must not exceed what is necessary
- Expected benefits must outweigh expected harms
- Consider both military and civilian effects

#### Last Resort (Ultima Ratio)

**Question:** Have non-violent alternatives been exhausted?

- Diplomatic solutions must be genuinely attempted
- War is permissible only when other means fail
- This does not require infinite delay if aggression is imminent

#### Probability of Success (Probabilitas Successus)

**Question:** Is there reasonable hope of achieving just aims?

- Futile wars that cannot succeed are not justified
- However, this must be balanced against duty to resist evil
- Small probability does not automatically disqualify

### Step 4: Apply Jus in Bello Criteria

Even in a just war, conduct must observe limits:

#### Discrimination (Distinctio)

- Non-combatants may not be directly targeted
- Combatants and civilians must be distinguished
- Civilian casualties may be tolerated only as unintended side effects (see double-effect-reasoning)

#### Proportionality in Means

- Force used must be proportionate to military objective
- Excessive destruction is prohibited
- Weapons that cause unnecessary suffering are forbidden

### Step 5: Render Overall Judgment

Synthesize the analysis:
1. Are ALL three primary conditions met?
2. Are the additional criteria satisfied?
3. Is conduct in war observing jus in bello?
4. What does justice require going forward?

## Example Application

**User question:** "Was the 2003 Iraq War just?"

**Just War Evaluation:**

**Condition 1: Legitimate Authority**
- Coalition forces were authorized by their respective governments
- UN Security Council did not authorize invasion
- PARTIAL - legitimate national authority, disputed international authority

**Condition 2: Just Cause**
- Stated causes: WMD threat, regime change, human rights
- WMD justification proved unfounded
- Regime change alone is not traditional just cause
- Human rights abuses were real but not immediate threat to invaders
- QUESTIONABLE - claimed causes were either false or insufficient

**Condition 3: Right Intention**
- Mixed motives alleged (oil, regional influence, unfinished business from 1991)
- Even if some intentions were good, presence of improper intentions taints
- DISPUTED - difficult to assess internal intentions of state actors

**Additional Criteria:**

*Proportionality:*
- Massive civilian casualties resulted
- Regional destabilization followed
- Benefits (removal of tyrant) must be weighed against years of chaos
- QUESTIONABLE - consequences arguably disproportionate

*Last Resort:*
- Inspections were ongoing when war began
- Containment had been working for over a decade
- QUESTIONABLE - peaceful alternatives not exhausted

*Probability of Success:*
- Military victory was highly probable (achieved quickly)
- Political success (stable democracy) was doubtful
- MIXED - depends on definition of "success"

**Overall Evaluation:**

The 2003 Iraq War fails to clearly satisfy the just war criteria:
- Just cause was asserted but not established
- Last resort was not observed
- Proportionality of consequences is doubtful
- Right intention is disputed

A prudent judgment would conclude that the war did not meet the requirements for just war, though reasonable people may disagree on particular points.

## Important Distinctions

### War vs. Police Action
Police action by legitimate authority against criminals differs from war between political communities. Different rules apply.

### Aggressor vs. Defender
The aggressor bears responsibility for initiating conflict. Defenders have broader latitude. But even defenders must observe jus in bello.

### Formal vs. Material Combatants
- Formal combatants: uniformed soldiers under command
- Material combatants: those contributing to war effort
- Unclear categories require applying principles with prudence

## Common Objections and Responses

### "All war is wrong"
Absolute pacifism fails to account for the duty to protect the innocent. If an aggressor attacks, refusal to defend allows injustice to triumph. The question is not whether any force is ever justified, but what force is justified when.

### "Just war theory is too restrictive"
The criteria are demanding because war is terrible. Setting a high bar for justification prevents wars of aggression and conquest while permitting genuine defense.

### "These criteria are too abstract to apply"
The criteria require practical judgment (prudence) in application. They do not mechanically determine outcomes but structure moral reasoning about complex situations.

### "Who decides if a war is just?"
Each party must judge for itself, but this does not mean all judgments are equally valid. Criteria provide objective standards against which claims can be evaluated.

## Integration Notes

**Parent Expert:** thomas-aquinas

**Related Skills:**
- **natural-law-analysis**: Just war criteria derive from natural law principles about justice and common good
- **double-effect-reasoning**: Applies to civilian casualties as unintended side effects
- **virtue-integration**: Just war requires prudence, justice, and fortitude properly ordered

**Skill Interaction:**
When evaluating just war, first establish the natural law foundation (why justice matters, what the common good requires). Then apply just war criteria. For complex cases involving civilian casualties, invoke double-effect-reasoning.
