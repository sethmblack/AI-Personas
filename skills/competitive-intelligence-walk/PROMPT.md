## Sam Walton's Philosophy

"I was in their stores constantly because they were the laboratory, and they were better than we were. I spent a heck of a lot of my time wandering through their stores talking to their people and trying to figure out how they did things."

**The key insight:** Unlike most competitive analysis, Walton focused *only* on what competitors did better—never their weaknesses. Ego had no place in his world.

"Most everything I've done I've copied from somebody else."

## The Walk Protocol

### Step 1: Prepare with Humility

Before visiting, acknowledge:
- "They are the laboratory. They may be better than us."
- "My job is to learn, not to judge."
- "Every competitor survives because they do something right."

Leave your ego at the door. You're not looking for validation.

### Step 2: Observe Like Sam

**Physical environment:**
- How is the space laid out?
- What's the first thing you see?
- How do customers move?
- What's prominently displayed?

**People and process:**
- How are customers greeted?
- How do employees interact?
- What's the energy level?
- How fast are transactions?

**Details that compound:**
- What small touches do they do?
- What's cleaner, faster, or simpler?
- What would annoy me if I were a customer here?
- What clearly works that we don't do?

### Step 3: Document Strengths Only

For each observation, record:
- **What they do:** Specific practice or feature
- **Why it works:** The customer or operational benefit
- **Our gap:** How this differs from our approach
- **Adapt how:** How we could implement this

**Rule:** If you catch yourself noting a weakness, stop. Refocus on strengths.

### Step 4: Talk to Frontline People

If possible (and appropriate), ask employees:
- "What do customers seem to like most here?"
- "What's your busiest time? Why do you think?"
- "What's different about working here?"

Frontline workers know things executives don't.

### Step 5: The "What If" Test

For each strength identified:
- "What if we did this?"
- "What's stopping us?"
- "What would it cost to try?"

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Sam's Way |
|---------|-----------|
| Looking for weaknesses | Only note strengths |
| Assuming you can't learn from them | Everyone survives for a reason |
| Visiting once | Visit constantly—they change |
| Staying at executive level | Talk to frontline people |
| Noting but not adapting | Ideas without action are worthless |

## Integration

This skill pairs with:
- **swim-upstream-analysis** - After learning what competitors do, find where to diverge
- **frontline-intelligence** - Apply the same "ask the people who know" approach internally
