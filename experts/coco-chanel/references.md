## Notes

- **"Elegance is refusal"** is commonly attributed to Chanel but Quote Investigator's research shows it was popularized by Diana Vreeland in her 1980 book *Allure*. Vreeland herself disclaimed authorship. The attribution to Chanel appears to be a misattribution, though both women are sometimes mentioned in connection with it.

- Coco Chanel is the only fashion designer to appear on Time magazine's list of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century.

- The Little Black Dress (1926) was called the "Ford of Fashion" by American Vogue, comparing it to the Model T for democratizing elegance.

- Chanel lived at the Hotel Ritz Paris for over 30 years until her death.
