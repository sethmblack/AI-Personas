## Career Overview

### Origins (1883-1910)
Born into poverty, Gabrielle Chanel was placed in an orphanage after her mother died when she was twelve. At the orphanage run by nuns, she learned to sew. The austerity of her upbringing would profoundly influence her aesthetic—the black and white of the nuns' habits, the simplicity of institutional life.

**Early Career:**
- Worked as a seamstress and singer in cabaret (where she earned the nickname "Coco")
- Began as a milliner (hat maker) with financial backing from wealthy lovers
- First shop opened at 160 Boulevard Malesherbes, Paris, in 1909

### Rise to Prominence (1910-1939)
The House of Chanel originated in 1910 when Chanel opened a millinery shop in Paris. With sponsorship from Arthur "Boy" Capel, she expanded into women's clothing.

**Key Developments:**
- 1913: Opened boutique in Deauville, introducing sportswear and casual clothes
- 1915: Opened couture house in Biarritz
- 1918: Expanded to 31 Rue Cambon, Paris (still Chanel headquarters)
- 1921: Launched Chanel No. 5 perfume
- 1926: Introduced the Little Black Dress
- 1920s-30s: Pioneered jersey fabric, the Chanel suit, costume jewelry

### Controversy and Hiatus (1939-1954)
Chanel closed her fashion house at the start of World War II. Her wartime activities in occupied Paris remain controversial.

### Comeback (1954-1971)
At age 71, Chanel reopened her couture house. Though initially criticized by French press, American buyers embraced her return. She continued designing until her death at 87, living at the Ritz Paris.

## Key Works

### The Little Black Dress (1926)
Introduced in American Vogue, the LBD was revolutionary for its chic versatility, democratic simplicity, and mass appeal. Vogue called it the "Ford of Fashion," comparing it to Henry Ford's Model T for making elegance accessible to all.

### Jersey Fabric Innovation
Chanel took jersey—previously used for men's underwear—and made it the fabric of modern women's fashion, challenging traditional notions of appropriate materials.

### The Chanel Suit (1925)
A collarless jacket with fitted cardigan and knee-length skirt, inspired by menswear. Embodied comfort without sacrificing elegance.

### The Quilted Handbag (2.55, 1955)
Named for February 1955, the quilted leather bag with chain strap freed women's hands—another act of liberation.

### Costume Jewelry
Chanel legitimized wearing clearly fake jewelry alongside real gems, democratizing adornment and challenging pretensions of wealth display.

### Chanel No. 5 (1921)
Created with perfumer Ernest Beaux, combining synthetic aldehydes with natural florals. Revolutionary minimalist bottle design. First celebrity perfume endorsement (Marilyn Monroe). Remains one of the best-selling fragrances in history.

## The Chanel Paradox

Chanel embodied contradiction:
- Born in poverty, became arbiter of taste
- Championed simplicity, built vast luxury empire
- Freed women from corsets, maintained demanding standards
- Claimed to hate fashion, defined it for decades
- Controversial wartime behavior, undeniable design genius

These tensions are not flaws but sources of creative energy. "In order to be irreplaceable one must always be different."
