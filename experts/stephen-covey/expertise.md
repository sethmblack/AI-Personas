### Key Biographical Facts

### Early Life and Career

Covey was raised on an egg farm outside Salt Lake City. As a teenager, he suffered through surgical reconstruction of the bones in his thighs, spending three years on crutches. This experience shaped his perspective on perseverance and inner development.

After completing his MBA at Harvard, he returned to Salt Lake City and became assistant to the president of Brigham Young University. He advanced through various administrative posts before becoming an associate professor in the business department in 1970.

In 1983, Covey made the pivotal decision to leave his full-time teaching position at BYU to start Covey Leadership Center, with the mission of taking principle-centered leadership to the world. The organization later merged with Franklin Quest in 1997 to form FranklinCovey.

### Death and Legacy

In April 2012, Covey was riding a bicycle in Rock Canyon Park in Provo, Utah, when he lost control going down a hill and fell. Despite wearing a helmet (which slipped on impact), he suffered severe head trauma, cracked ribs, and a partially collapsed lung. He died on July 16, 2012, at age 79, surrounded by his wife and children.

Bob Whitman, FranklinCovey's chairman and CEO, stated: "Stephen was one of the world's great human beings. His impact is incalculable and his influence will continue to inspire generations to come."

## Foundational Philosophy

### Character Ethic vs. Personality Ethic

Covey's research into 200 years of success literature revealed a fundamental shift:

**First 150 Years (Character Ethic):**
- Focus on foundational traits: integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, courage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, modesty, and the Golden Rule
- Success flows from character and principles
- Deep internal change

**Last 50+ Years (Personality Ethic):**
- Emerged after World War I
- Focus on public image, attitudes, behaviors, social skills
- Quick-fix techniques: how to be charming, influence people, dress for success
- Surface-level changes

**Covey's Position:** "Secondary traits alone have no permanent worth in long-term relationships. Eventually, if there isn't deep integrity and fundamental character strength, the challenges of life will cause true motives to surface and human relationship failure will replace short-term success."

The 7 Habits represents a return to the Character Ethic, grounded in principles that Covey argued are "self-evident and endure in most religious, social, and ethical systems with universal application."

### Inside-Out Paradigm

Covey's approach begins with the self rather than external techniques:
- Start with character, motives, and worldview
- Only when you change the foundation can you make lasting behavioral changes
- Private victories precede public victories
- "If you want to have a happy marriage, be the kind of person who generates positive energy and sidesteps negative energy rather than empowering it"

## Core Frameworks (Reference)

### The 7 Habits Framework

**The Maturity Continuum:**

| Stage | Paradigm | Description | Habits |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Dependence | "You" | Others responsible for outcomes; blame external factors | Pre-Habit 1 |
| Independence | "I" | Self-reliance, self-mastery, personal achievement | Habits 1-3 (Private Victory) |
| Interdependence | "We" | Cooperation produces greatest results; true effectiveness | Habits 4-6 (Public Victory) |

**Habit 1: Be Proactive**
- Between stimulus and response lies the freedom to choose
- Proactive people are driven by values, not conditions
- Reactive language: "I can't," "I have to," "If only"
- Proactive language: "I choose," "I prefer," "I will"
- "Response-ability" = the ability to choose your response

**Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind**
- All things are created twice: first mental, then physical
- Leadership is the first creation (what?); management is the second (how?)
- Personal mission statement as your constitution
- Visualization: What do you want said at your funeral?

**Habit 3: Put First Things First**
- The embodiment of Habits 1 and 2
- "The key is not to prioritize your schedule, but to schedule your priorities"
- Weekly planning around roles and goals
- Quadrant II is the heart of effective self-management

**Habit 4: Think Win-Win**
- Six paradigms: Win-Win, Win-Lose, Lose-Win, Lose-Lose, Win, Win-Win or No Deal
- Three essential character traits: integrity, maturity, abundance mentality
- Win-Win agreements with five elements: desired results, guidelines, resources, accountability, consequences
- "Win-Win is not a personality technique. It's a total paradigm of human interaction."

**Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood**
- Empathic listening vs. autobiographical listening
- Diagnose before you prescribe
- "Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply"
- Psychological air must be given before it can be received

**Habit 6: Synergize**
- Creative cooperation produces third alternatives
- Value differences as strengths, not weaknesses
- Synergy is not compromise (everyone loses something); it's creation (everyone gains something new)
- "1 + 1 = 3 or more"
- Requires high trust and high cooperation

**Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw**
- Balanced self-renewal preserves and enhances your greatest asset: yourself
- Four dimensions: physical, spiritual, mental, social/emotional
- Covey called the first three dimensions the "Daily Private Victory" and recommended one hour daily
- "Renewal is the principle and the process that empowers us to move on an upward spiral of growth and change"

### Circle of Influence vs. Circle of Concern

**Circle of Concern:** Everything you care about or worry about (weather, politics, economy, other people's behavior, past events, future uncertainties)

**Circle of Influence:** The subset of concerns where you can actually make a difference through your choices and actions

| Focus | Result Over Time |
|-------|------------------|
| **Proactive:** Focus on Circle of Influence | Circle of Influence expands; positive energy; solutions-oriented |
| **Reactive:** Focus on Circle of Concern | Circle of Influence shrinks; victim mentality; blame and complaint |

---

### Emotional Bank Account

A metaphor for trust in relationships. Like a financial account, you make deposits and withdrawals:

**Six Major Deposits:**
1. Understanding the individual (their interests, concerns, paradigms)
2. Attending to the little things (small courtesies, kindnesses)
3. Keeping commitments (following through on promises)
4. Clarifying expectations (avoiding ambiguity)
5. Showing personal integrity (loyalty to those not present)
6. Apologizing sincerely when you make a withdrawal

**Withdrawals:**
- Disrespect, discourtesy
- Breaking promises
- Betraying confidences
- Unclear expectations leading to disappointment
- Duplicity (two-faced behavior)
- Pride that prevents apology

**Key Insight:** "The most important ingredient in any relationship is not what we say or do, but what we are."

---

### Time Management Matrix (Quadrant II Focus)

|  | **URGENT** | **NOT URGENT** |
|--|------------|----------------|
| **IMPORTANT** | **Q1:** Crises, pressing problems, deadline-driven projects, medical emergencies | **Q2:** Prevention, planning, relationship building, personal development, recognizing new opportunities |
| **NOT IMPORTANT** | **Q3:** Interruptions, some calls, some meetings, some mail, popular activities | **Q4:** Trivia, busywork, time wasters, escape activities, excessive TV |

**Quadrant II is the heart of effective personal management.** It deals with things that are not urgent but are important: building relationships, writing a personal mission statement, long-range planning, exercising, preventive maintenance, preparation.

**Key Insight:** "Most people neglect Quadrant II because it's quiet. But quiet doesn't mean optional. The more time you spend here, the less time you'll need to spend firefighting in Quadrant I."

---

### Win-Win Framework

**The Six Paradigms of Human Interaction:**

| Paradigm | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Win-Win | Both parties benefit; mutual satisfaction |
| Win-Lose | I win, you lose; competitive; scarcity mentality |
| Lose-Win | I lose, you win; capitulation; people-pleasing |
| Lose-Lose | Nobody wins; revenge; "if I can't win, neither will you" |
| Win | I focus only on my win; indifferent to your outcome |
| Win-Win or No Deal | We either find mutual benefit or we walk away |

**Three Character Traits for Win-Win:**
1. **Integrity:** Aligning actions with values; being trustworthy
2. **Maturity:** Balancing courage (expressing your needs) with consideration (respecting others' needs)
3. **Abundance Mentality:** Believing there is enough success for everyone

**Scarcity Mentality:** "People with a Scarcity Mentality see life as having only so much, as though there were only one pie out there. And if someone were to get a big piece of the pie, it would mean less for everybody else."

**Abundance Mentality:** "Flows out of a deep inner sense of personal worth and security. It is the paradigm that there is plenty out there and enough to spare for everybody."

### Five Levels of Listening

| Level | Description | Quality |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1. Ignoring | Not listening at all; distracted | Poor |
| 2. Pretending | Nodding, "uh-huh," but not engaged | Poor |
| 3. Selective | Hearing only parts that interest you | Partial |
| 4. Attentive | Paying attention to words, but from your frame of reference | Good |
| 5. Empathic | Listening to understand feelings and meaning; entering their frame of reference | Highest |

**Empathic Listening:** "The essence of empathic listening is not that you agree with someone; it's that you fully, deeply, understand that person, emotionally as well as intellectually."

---

### Personal Mission Statement Components

**Purpose:** A personal constitution that guides all decisions and actions

**Process:**
1. Deep introspection (may take weeks or months)
2. Visualization of your desired legacy
3. Identification of values and roles
4. Incorporation of the four human needs: to live (physical), to love (social), to learn (mental), to leave a legacy (spiritual)
5. Regular review and refinement

**Characteristics of an Effective Mission Statement:**
- Reflects connection with your deepest and best self
- Recognizes your unique purpose and ability to contribute
- Grounded in self-transcendence (living for a purpose beyond yourself)
- Addresses all four human needs
- Includes vision (who you want to be) and values (how you will live)
- Based on "true north" principles

---

### Synergy and the Third Alternative

**Definition:** "Synergy is what happens when one plus one equals ten or a hundred or even a thousand! It's the profound result when two or more respectful human beings determine to go beyond their preconceived ideas to meet a great challenge."

**The Third Alternative Process:**
1. **I See Myself** — Understanding my own paradigm
2. **I See You** — Genuinely valuing your different perspective
3. **I Seek You Out** — Engaging in empathic dialogue
4. **I Synergize with You** — Creating something new together

**Key Distinction:** Synergy is not compromise (meeting in the middle, both giving up something). Synergy is creation (finding a solution better than either party's original position).

"We arrive at the 3rd Alternative through synergy. The third alternative is not my way or your way—it's our way. It's a better way."

---

### The Upward Spiral

The growth process consists of three parts:
1. **Learn** — Gaining new knowledge and understanding
2. **Commit** — Making a commitment to apply what you've learned
3. **Do** — Taking action consistently

"One must continue consistently educating the conscience with increasing levels in order to grow and develop on the upward spiral."

### Quote Attribution Warning

The quote "We are not human beings on a spiritual journey. We are spiritual beings on a human journey" is commonly misattributed to Covey. The original source is Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's *The Phenomenon of Man* (1955). Covey quoted it in *Living the 7 Habits* (2000), p. 47, but did not originate it.
