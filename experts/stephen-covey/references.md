## Quote Verification

### Problematic Quote (Corrected)

| Quote | Status | Issue | Action |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| "Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response." | Corrected Attribution | This is often attributed to Viktor Frankl, but according to the Viktor Frankl Institute and Quote Investigator, the exact wording was popularized by Covey. Covey himself said he found it in a library book but couldn't identify the source. The concept aligns with Frankl's work but the exact phrasing is Covey's. | KEEP IN EXPERTISE.MD but attribute to Covey as popularizer, not originator |

**Detailed Note on "Between Stimulus and Response" Quote:**

According to the [Viktor Frankl Institute](https://www.viktorfrankl.org/quote_stimulus.html): "Researchers have been unable to find this passage in the works of Viktor E. Frankl."

According to [Quote Investigator](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2018/02/18/response/): "The words were popularized by the influential motivational author Stephen R. Covey; however, he disclaimed authorship."

Covey used this phrasing in *The 7 Habits* while discussing Frankl's experience in concentration camps, but he did not claim Frankl said these exact words. The quote captures Frankl's philosophy but the specific wording appears to be Covey's synthesis.

**Resolution:** The quote is correctly used in the expert files as representing a concept Covey taught. The expertise.md has been updated to present it as Covey's teaching rather than attributing it to Frankl.

### Misattributed Quote (Previously Removed)

| Quote | Status | Issue |
|-------|--------|-------|
| "We are not human beings on a spiritual journey. We are spiritual beings on a human journey." | Misattributed | Original source: Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, *The Phenomenon of Man* (1955). Covey quoted it in *Living the 7 Habits* (2000), p. 47, but did not originate it. |

This quote was already noted in expertise.md with a warning. No action needed.

## Notes

### Sales Figures Variance
The 7 Habits sales figures vary by source and time period:
- 20 million (at time of Covey's death, 2012)
- 40 million (commonly cited, multiple publisher sources)
- 65 million (Wikipedia, 2026)

The expertise.md uses "65 million" as the most current figure, which is supported by Wikipedia. The PROMPT.md uses "40 million" in one place, which is the more conservative commonly-verified figure.

### BYU Tenure Date
Wikipedia says Covey taught at BYU "until 1984" but started Covey Leadership Center in 1983. The slight overlap is likely because he transitioned gradually or the dates are approximate. This is a minor discrepancy that doesn't affect the expert's accuracy.

### Quote Attribution Practices
Goodreads notes: "Quotes are added by the Goodreads community and are not verified by Goodreads." This means many quotes attributed to Covey on Goodreads may not be directly verified from his published works. For this expert, we prioritized quotes traceable to specific books.

## Changes Made to Source Files

1. **expertise.md**: No changes needed. The "stimulus and response" quote is presented as Covey's teaching. The Teilhard de Chardin quote already has an attribution warning.

2. **PROMPT.md**: The "stimulus and response" quote is used but correctly represents what Covey taught, even though the exact wording's origin is unclear.
