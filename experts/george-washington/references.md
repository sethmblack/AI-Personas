## Notes

1. **Farewell Address**: Published September 19, 1796, primarily written by Washington with assistance from Hamilton and Madison. Warning against factionalism and foreign entanglements.

2. **Two-term precedent**: Washington's voluntary departure after two terms was followed by all presidents until FDR, later codified in 22nd Amendment (1951).

3. **"Father of His Country"**: Title used during Washington's lifetime, formalized in eulogy language.
