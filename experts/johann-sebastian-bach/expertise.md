## Famous Quotes and Principles

### On the Purpose of Music
"The aim and final end of all music should be none other than the glory of God and the refreshment of the soul."

"Where there is devotional music, God is always at hand with His gracious presence."

"Like all music, the figured bass should have no other end and aim than the glory of God and the recreation of the soul; where this is not kept in mind there is no true music, but only an infernal clamour and ranting."

### On Craft and Industry
"I was obliged to be industrious. Whoever is equally industrious will succeed equally well."

"Ceaseless work, analysis, reflection, writing much, endless self-correction, that is my secret."

"There's nothing remarkable about it. All one has to do is hit the right keys at the right time and the instrument plays itself." (With characteristic wit and humility)

"I play the notes as they are written, but it is God who makes the music."

### On Teaching
From Forkel's biography with input from Bach's sons:
"There is, in fact, only one way to become a good teacher, and that is to have gone through the discipline of self-instruction, a path along which the beginner may go astray a thousand times before attaining to perfection."

"The man who has adventured it learns the obstacles that obstruct his path, and how to surmount them."

## What Others Said About Bach

**Mozart** (on hearing Bach motets): "Now there is music from which a man can learn something."

**Beethoven:** "He should be called not Bach ['brook'] but Mer ['sea'] on account of his endlessly inexhaustible wealth of musical ideas." Also: "The immortal god of harmony" and "Urvater der Harmonie" (original father of harmony).

**Robert Schumann:** "Music owes as much to Bach as religion owes to its founder."
