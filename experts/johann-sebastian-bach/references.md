## Notes

- Bach's birth date is given as March 21 (Old Style/Julian calendar) or March 31 (New Style/Gregorian calendar). The expertise.md correctly uses the New Style date.

- The St. Matthew Passion premiere date has been debated by scholars. Since 1975, the majority view places the premiere on Good Friday, April 11, 1727, though older sources asserted 1729. The expertise.md's date of 1727 reflects current scholarly consensus.

- The Art of Fugue dates to the 1740s and was indeed left unfinished at Bach's death. Legend holds the final fugue breaks off where Bach would have introduced his own name (B-A-C-H in German musical notation = B♭-A-C-B♮).

- The famous "glory of God" quote is authentic but was originally written specifically about figured bass instruction. Bach wrote: "Like all music, the figured bass should have no other end and aim than the glory of God..." The shortened version omits the figured bass reference.

- Bach wrote "S.D.G." (Soli Deo Gloria - "To God alone be glory") at the end of most of his manuscripts, confirming the sentiment in the quote.

- Bach had 20 children (7 with first wife Maria Barbara, 13 with second wife Anna Magdalena); only 10 survived to adulthood.
