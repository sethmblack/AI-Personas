## HIGH Priority

### 1. contrapuntal-problem-solving

**Source Pattern:** Counterpoint / Fugue Structure / Multiple Voices
**Purpose:** Analyze complex situations as multiple independent voices that must work together while maintaining their own integrity.
**Trigger:** "How do I balance competing priorities?" or "Multiple stakeholders need different things" or "Help me think through this complexity"
**Inputs:** Description of situation with multiple elements, stakeholders, or priorities that seem in tension
**Outputs:** Mapping of "voices" and their melodies, identification of parallel vs contrary motion opportunities, suggested counterpoint structure, dissonance points requiring resolution
**Reasoning:** This is Bach's core contribution - the art of making independent things work together. Highly actionable framework with clear steps. Applicable to team management, project planning, life balance, stakeholder alignment. Distinctive trigger phrases. Saves significant time by providing structure for complexity.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear steps: identify voices, find cantus firmus, map movements, locate dissonances, compose resolution |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers: "competing priorities," "balance," "multiple stakeholders," "complexity" |
| Scoped | 10 | Single responsibility: turning complexity into structured harmony |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to any multi-element situation: teams, projects, life, organizations |
| Valuable | 10 | Transforms overwhelming complexity into workable structure |

**Total: 49/50 - HIGH**

### 2. constraint-creativity-framework

**Source Pattern:** Constraints and Creativity / Working Within Limitations
**Purpose:** Transform perceived limitations into creative catalysts by reframing constraints as enabling structures.
**Trigger:** "I'm limited by..." or "If only I didn't have this constraint..." or "How do I work within these restrictions?"
**Inputs:** Description of constraints or limitations, desired outcome, current frustration
**Outputs:** Reframing of constraints as creative frameworks, specific techniques for finding richness within limits, examples of how the constraint enables what freedom would not
**Reasoning:** Bach's genius was finding infinite variety within strict forms. This counter-intuitive wisdom (constraints liberate) is immediately actionable. Saves time and energy wasted fighting unchangeable conditions.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear reframing process with specific output |
| Invocable | 10 | Very natural trigger phrases around constraints/limitations |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: transforming relationship to constraints |
| Reusable | 10 | Universal: any constraint situation in any domain |
| Valuable | 10 | Shifts mindset from frustration to creativity |

**Total: 48/50 - HIGH**

### 3. theme-and-variations-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Organicism / Subject Development / Theme and Variations
**Purpose:** Take a core principle or idea and systematically explore how it manifests across different contexts, using development techniques (inversion, augmentation, transposition).
**Trigger:** "How do I apply this principle across situations?" or "Show me the variations" or "This value means what in practice?"
**Inputs:** Core principle, value, or theme; contexts or situations where it must apply
**Outputs:** The theme stated clearly; variations showing application in different "keys" (contexts); inversion (what it looks like as opposite); augmentation/diminution (expanded vs compressed versions)
**Reasoning:** Bach could generate an entire work from a single subject. This skill teaches the same: depth over breadth, one idea fully developed. Practical for values clarification, principle application, consistent decision-making.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear process: state theme, generate variations systematically |
| Invocable | 8 | Triggers around applying principles, values, consistency |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: exploring one idea across contexts |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to values, principles, strategies, messaging |
| Valuable | 9 | Creates consistency and depth from single source |

**Total: 44/50 - HIGH**

### 4. foundation-first-methodology

**Source Pattern:** Figured Bass / Thoroughbass Foundation / Fundamental-Regeln
**Purpose:** Establish foundational principles before building details, ensuring structure supports elaboration.
**Trigger:** "I'm lost in the details" or "Where do I start?" or "What's the foundation here?" or "Build from the ground up"
**Inputs:** Complex situation with many elements, proposed solution with unclear priorities, overwhelm from detail
**Outputs:** Identification of the "bass line" (foundational principles), clear hierarchy of what supports what, recommendations for building up from foundation
**Reasoning:** Bach built from thoroughbass upward. This prevents the common error of decorating without structure. Highly practical for planning, architecture, argument construction, decision-making.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear process: identify foundation, establish hierarchy, build up |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers around getting lost, finding foundation, starting points |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: establishing structural foundation |
| Reusable | 10 | Universal: any complex building process |
| Valuable | 9 | Prevents wasted effort on unsupported elaboration |

**Total: 46/50 - HIGH**

### 5. craft-mastery-path

**Source Pattern:** Teaching Method / Pedagogical Approach / Industry and Practice
**Purpose:** Design a systematic path to mastery through progressive difficulty, daily practice, and practical example-based learning.
**Trigger:** "How do I get better at this?" or "Design a learning path" or "What's the practice regimen?" or "I want to master..."
**Inputs:** Skill or domain to master, current level, available practice time, goals
**Outputs:** Structured progression from fundamentals to mastery, specific daily practice recommendations, model-based learning approach, milestone markers
**Reasoning:** Bach was one of history's great teachers, with proven pedagogical methods. This skill applies his approach to any learning goal. Practical, specific, and battle-tested over centuries.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear output: progression, daily practice, milestones |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers around learning, mastery, improvement |
| Scoped | 8 | Broad but unified: designing learning paths |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to any skill acquisition |
| Valuable | 9 | Provides structure for otherwise vague self-improvement |

**Total: 46/50 - HIGH**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 6. well-tempered-preparation

**Source Pattern:** Well-Tempered Clavier / All 24 Keys / Systematic Coverage
**Purpose:** Prepare for uncertainty by systematically working through all possible conditions, keys, and scenarios.
**Trigger:** "How do I prepare for the unexpected?" or "What scenarios should I consider?" or "Practice in all keys"
**Inputs:** Upcoming situation with uncertainty, core message or approach, range of possible conditions
**Outputs:** Identification of "keys" (scenario dimensions), systematic preparation for each, practice recommendations for full range
**Reasoning:** Bach wrote in all 24 keys to demonstrate complete mastery. This skill applies the principle to any uncertain situation. Useful for presentations, negotiations, contingency planning. Slightly narrower scope than others.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Clear process: identify dimensions, practice each systematically |
| Invocable | 7 | Triggers around preparation and scenarios |
| Scoped | 8 | Single responsibility: systematic preparation |
| Reusable | 8 | Applies to any preparation situation |
| Valuable | 8 | Reduces anxiety, increases readiness |

**Total: 39/50 - MEDIUM**

### 7. dissonance-resolution-technique

**Source Pattern:** Counterpoint Rules / Dissonance Treatment
**Purpose:** Handle conflicts and tensions by preparing, sounding, and resolving them properly rather than avoiding them.
**Trigger:** "There's conflict here I don't know how to handle" or "How do I deal with this tension?"
**Inputs:** Description of conflict or tension, parties involved, current avoidance patterns
**Outputs:** Reframing of conflict as necessary dissonance, preparation strategy, sounding approach, resolution path
**Reasoning:** Bach's counterpoint requires dissonance for beauty - but treated correctly. Maps directly to conflict management. Slightly subsumed by contrapuntal-problem-solving but has specific application.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Clear prepare-sound-resolve sequence |
| Invocable | 7 | Conflict/tension triggers |
| Scoped | 8 | Specific to conflict handling |
| Reusable | 8 | Any interpersonal or organizational conflict |
