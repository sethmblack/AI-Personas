## HIGH Priority

### 1. power-dynamics-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Signature Analytical Framework
**Purpose:** Analyze any situation through Machiavelli's six-step framework to reveal true interests, capabilities, and strategic options.
**Trigger:** "Analyze the power dynamics here" or "What's really going on in this situation?" or "Give me a Machiavellian analysis"
**Inputs:** Description of situation, parties involved, apparent conflict or decision point
**Outputs:** Structured analysis covering: interests, capabilities, constraints, tactical approach (fox/lion), historical parallels, and unsentimental prescription
**Reasoning:** This is the core Machiavelli methodology—a complete analytical framework with 6 clear steps. Highly reusable across negotiations, organizational politics, strategy, and conflict analysis. Saves significant time by providing a rigorous structure for strategic thinking.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 6 explicit steps with clear outputs
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases exist
- Scoped: YES - one responsibility (strategic situation analysis)
- Reusable: YES - applies to business, politics, personal strategy
- Valuable: YES - transforms unstructured situations into clear strategic pictures

### 2. fox-lion-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Fox and the Lion
**Purpose:** Determine whether a situation calls for cunning (fox) or force (lion), and recommend the appropriate tactical approach.
**Trigger:** "Should I use force or finesse here?" or "Fox or lion?" or "What's the right tactical approach?"
**Inputs:** Description of opponent/situation, your capabilities, constraints on action
**Outputs:** Tactical recommendation (fox, lion, or alternating), rationale based on opponent type, specific actions aligned to chosen approach
**Reasoning:** Machiavelli's most famous tactical framework. Clear binary with explicit criteria for selection. Immediately applicable to negotiations, conflicts, competitive situations. Saves time by cutting through ambiguity about approach.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear decision criteria and action recommendations
- Invocable: YES - distinctive trigger phrase ("fox or lion")
- Scoped: YES - single tactical decision
- Reusable: YES - applies to any adversarial or competitive situation
- Valuable: YES - prevents costly misapplication of tactics

## MEDIUM Priority

### 3. fortune-virtu-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Virtù and Fortuna / Fortune and Virtù Analysis
**Purpose:** Separate what's within control (virtù) from what's circumstance (fortuna) to focus action appropriately.
**Trigger:** "What can I actually control here?" or "Analyze fortune vs. virtù" or "Where should I focus my energy?"
**Inputs:** Situation description, factors at play, current resources/capabilities
**Outputs:** Two-column analysis (fortune vs. virtù), recommendations for building "dams and dikes" against fortune, identification of virtù opportunities
**Reasoning:** Core Machiavellian concept that prevents wasted effort on uncontrollable factors. 3-step process: identify fortune factors, identify virtù factors, prescribe action. Widely applicable to strategic planning and personal effectiveness.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear categorization process and output
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases
- Scoped: YES - factor categorization and action focus
- Reusable: YES - applies to any planning or strategic situation
- Valuable: YES - prevents common error of fighting fortune

### 4. decisive-action-framework

**Source Pattern:** Well-Used Cruelty vs. Poorly-Used Cruelty / The Economy of Cruelty
**Purpose:** When difficult action is necessary, determine whether it should be swift and complete or gradual, and how to execute with minimum long-term damage.
**Trigger:** "How should I handle this difficult decision?" or "Should I act quickly or gradually?" or "I need to make cuts/changes—what's the right approach?"
**Inputs:** Difficult action contemplated (layoffs, restructuring, conflict resolution, ending relationships), constraints, desired end state
**Outputs:** Recommendation on timing (swift vs. gradual), execution guidance, warning signs of "poorly-used" approach, follow-up actions to convert injuries to benefits
**Reasoning:** Addresses universal challenge of painful decisions. Clear criteria distinguish well-used (swift, complete, not persisted) from poorly-used (gradual, escalating, creating enemies). Prevents common leadership mistake of death by a thousand cuts.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear criteria and execution guidance
- Invocable: YES - triggered by difficult decision scenarios
- Scoped: YES - timing and intensity of difficult actions
- Reusable: YES - layoffs, restructuring, conflict, negotiations
- Valuable: YES - prevents costly error pattern

### 5. corruption-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** Corruption and Republics
**Purpose:** Assess organizational or institutional health using Machiavelli's five-stage corruption framework.
**Trigger:** "Is this organization healthy?" or "Diagnose institutional corruption" or "Why is this organization failing?"
**Inputs:** Description of organization, observable behaviors, history of recent decisions
**Outputs:** Stage assessment (1-5 on corruption spectrum), specific indicators identified, prognosis, recommendations for reform (with reform paradox warning)
**Reasoning:** Machiavelli's institutional decay framework is remarkably applicable to modern organizations. 5-stage model provides clear diagnostic. Includes important reform paradox insight. Useful for consultants, leaders, and organizational analysis.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 5-stage diagnostic with clear indicators
- Invocable: YES - organizational health questions
- Scoped: YES - institutional corruption diagnosis
- Reusable: YES - companies, governments, nonprofits
- Valuable: YES - reveals hidden organizational decay

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Feared vs. Loved | Subsumed by power-dynamics-assessment and fox-lion-assessment as a consideration, not standalone workflow |
| Historical Parallels | Knowledge/reference technique, not actionable workflow—requires deep historical knowledge to execute |
| Famous Maxims | Reference material and quotations, no workflow |
| Biographical Context | Pure reference information |
| Key Works Descriptions | Reference material for understanding Machiavelli, not actionable |
| Misunderstandings to Correct | Explanatory material, not workflow |
| On Advisors | Advice principle, insufficient structure for skill |
| On Appearances | Advice principle, insufficient structure for skill |
| On Keeping Promises | Advice principle, context-dependent judgment call |
| Mixed Constitution | Institutional design principle, too abstract for standalone skill |
