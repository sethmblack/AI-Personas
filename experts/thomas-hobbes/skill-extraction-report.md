## HIGH Priority

### 1. state-of-nature-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The State of Nature Argument
**Purpose:** Analyze any situation by imagining what would happen if the current authority structure disappeared—revealing the underlying interests, conflicts, and power dynamics that existing institutions suppress.
**Trigger:** "What happens without authority?" or "Analyze the power vacuum" or "What if this structure collapsed?"
**Inputs:** Description of current situation, authority structure, or institution
**Outputs:** Analysis of latent conflicts, competing interests, likely outcomes if authority disappeared, and assessment of what currently maintains order
**Reasoning:** This is Hobbes's core analytical method—the thought experiment that reveals what lies beneath apparent stability. Highly reusable for analyzing organizations, political situations, markets, and any system where authority is contested or weakening.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear thought experiment with specific outputs
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases exist
- Scoped: YES - one responsibility (authority failure analysis)
- Reusable: YES - applies to politics, business, international relations
- Valuable: YES - reveals hidden fragility and true power dynamics

### 2. covenant-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Sword and Covenant / Covenants Require Enforcement
**Purpose:** Evaluate the durability of any agreement by examining its enforcement mechanisms. Determine whether a covenant will hold or fail.
**Trigger:** "Will this agreement hold?" or "Analyze this contract/treaty/deal" or "What enforces this?"
**Inputs:** Description of agreement, parties involved, stated terms, enforcement mechanisms (if any)
**Outputs:** Assessment of enforcement strength, identification of who bears costs if agreement breaks, prediction of durability, recommendations for strengthening
**Reasoning:** Hobbes's insight that "covenants without the sword are but words" provides a rigorous framework for evaluating any agreement. Immediately applicable to business contracts, international treaties, partnership agreements, and organizational commitments.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear assessment criteria and outputs
- Invocable: YES - triggered by agreement evaluation requests
- Scoped: YES - single responsibility (agreement durability)
- Reusable: YES - contracts, treaties, partnerships, informal agreements
- Valuable: YES - prevents naive trust in unenforceable commitments

### 3. sovereign-design

**Source Pattern:** Absolute Sovereignty / Authority Must Be Undivided
**Purpose:** Design or evaluate governance structures by ensuring clear, undivided authority with defined enforcement mechanisms.
**Trigger:** "How should this authority be structured?" or "Design the governance" or "Who has final say?"
**Inputs:** Decision domain, stakeholders, existing authority claims, constraints
**Outputs:** Governance design with clear sovereign authority, decision rights matrix, enforcement mechanisms, analysis of divided-authority risks
**Reasoning:** Hobbes's argument that divided sovereignty is no sovereignty provides a framework for designing clear governance. Applicable to corporate governance, organizational design, partnership structures, and any situation requiring clear decision authority.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - produces specific governance recommendations
- Invocable: YES - natural triggers around authority design
- Scoped: YES - governance structure design
- Reusable: YES - organizations, partnerships, institutions
- Valuable: YES - prevents authority disputes and paralysis

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. fear-and-interest-mapping

**Source Pattern:** Human Nature and Psychology / Fear as Primary Motive
**Purpose:** Map the true motivations driving behavior by identifying what each party fears and desires, stripped of stated positions and moral justifications.
**Trigger:** "What are the real motivations?" or "Map the interests" or "What do they actually fear?"
**Inputs:** Situation description, parties involved, stated positions, observable behaviors
**Outputs:** Interest/fear matrix for each party, analysis of alignment vs. conflict, prediction of behavior under pressure
**Reasoning:** Hobbes's psychology of appetite, aversion, and the desire for power provides a framework for stripping away pretense to reveal actual motivations. Useful for negotiations, conflict analysis, and understanding organizational politics.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - produces motivation map and behavioral predictions
- Invocable: YES - triggered by motivation/interest questions
- Scoped: YES - motivation analysis
- Reusable: YES - negotiations, politics, organizational dynamics
- Valuable: YES - reveals true drivers beneath stated positions

### 5. laws-of-nature-application

**Source Pattern:** The Laws of Nature / Nineteen Natural Laws
**Purpose:** Apply Hobbes's laws of nature as a framework for establishing rational cooperation in the absence of trust.
**Trigger:** "How do we cooperate without trust?" or "What rational principles should govern this?"
**Inputs:** Parties seeking cooperation, areas of conflict, constraints, mutual vulnerabilities
**Outputs:** Applicable laws of nature, mutual obligation framework, conditions for sustainable cooperation
**Reasoning:** While less famous than the state of nature, Hobbes's laws of nature provide positive principles for cooperation. The first three laws (seek peace, lay down rights reciprocally, keep covenants) offer a framework for building rational agreements.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - applies specific laws to situations
- Invocable: YES - triggered by cooperation-building scenarios
- Scoped: YES - rational cooperation framework
- Reusable: YES - negotiations, partnerships, conflict resolution
- Valuable: MODERATE - less distinctive than other Hobbesian frameworks

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Materialism/Mechanism | Philosophical stance informing voice, not actionable workflow |
| Church-State Relations | Historical analysis, too narrow for general application |
| Famous Maxims | Reference material and quotations, no workflow |
| Biographical Context | Pure reference information |
| Key Works Descriptions | Reference material for understanding Hobbes, not actionable |
| Hobbes vs. Locke Comparison | Explanatory material, not workflow |
| Misunderstandings to Correct | Clarification material, not actionable framework |

## Selected Skills for Creation

Based on the analysis, the following 4 skills are recommended for creation:

1. **state-of-nature-analysis** (HIGH) - Core Hobbesian method
2. **covenant-assessment** (HIGH) - Immediately practical
3. **sovereign-design** (HIGH) - Governance design framework
4. **fear-and-interest-mapping** (MEDIUM) - Motivation analysis

The fifth candidate (laws-of-nature-application) is deferred as less distinctive and partially subsumed by the others.
