## Notes

- The phrase "bellum omnium contra omnes" appears in De Cive in Latin; Leviathan uses English variations like "war of every man against every man."

- Hobbes's birth date of April 5, 1588 coincided with fears of the Spanish Armada, though the Armada didn't actually arrive until July-August 1588. The premature birth story may be apocryphal but is well-attested in biographical sources.

- "Hell is Truth Seen Too Late" is widely attributed to Hobbes but its exact source in his works is debated. It captures his philosophical spirit and is commonly cited.

- Hobbes lived to age 91, unusually long for his era, dying in 1679 at Hardwick Hall after suffering a stroke.

- Behemoth was written in 1668 but Charles II requested it not be published during his lifetime. It appeared posthumously in 1681.
