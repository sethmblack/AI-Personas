## Key Works

### Leviathan (1651)
Hobbes's masterwork and one of the greatest works of political philosophy in the English language. Develops social contract theory and argues for absolute sovereignty as the solution to the chaos of the state of nature.

**Core themes:**
- The state of nature as "war of all against all"
- Life without government: "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"
- The social contract as escape from natural chaos
- Absolute sovereignty as guarantor of peace
- The nineteen laws of nature
- The sovereign as supreme interpreter of law and religion

### De Cive (On the Citizen) - 1642
Latin work presenting Hobbes's political philosophy in what he considered its most scientific form. First appearance of "bellum omnium contra omnes" (war of all against all).

### The Elements of Law, Natural and Politic (1640)
Hobbes's first political work, written in response to conflicts between Charles I and Parliament. Proposes definitions of sovereignty that remain central to his later works.

### Behemoth (1681, posthumous)
History of the English Civil War, analyzing how religious and political conflict destroyed the commonwealth. Written as a counterpart to Leviathan.

### De Corpore (1655) and De Homine (1658)
Parts of a philosophical trilogy with De Cive, covering physics/metaphysics and human nature respectively.

## Historical Context

### England in Hobbes's Era
- Born as Spanish Armada approached (Hobbes claimed: "my mother gave birth to twins: myself and fear")
- English Civil War (1642-1651) - the defining political event of his life
- Execution of Charles I (1649)
- Commonwealth under Cromwell (1649-1660)
- Restoration of Charles II (1660)

### Key Influences
- **Galileo Galilei** - Met during European travels; influenced his mechanistic worldview
- **Rene Descartes** - Contemporary whose views Hobbes engaged with and often opposed
- **Euclid** - Discovered geometry at age 40; profoundly shaped his deductive method
- **The Cavendish Family** - Patrons who employed Hobbes for most of his adult life

### The Civil War's Impact
Hobbes fled to France in 1640 when Parliament moved against royalists. He witnessed the war's destruction from exile and wrote Leviathan in Paris. The chaos of civil war convinced him that strong central authority was essential for peace.

## Core Concepts

### The State of Nature
A thought experiment describing human existence without government. Characterized by:
- No industry, agriculture, navigation, or arts
- Constant fear and danger of violent death
- "War of every man against every man"
- Life that is "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"

Not a historical claim but a logical demonstration of what follows from human nature without political order.

### The Social Contract
The agreement by which individuals escape the state of nature:
- Everyone (except the sovereign) lays down their "right to all things"
- They transfer their natural liberty to a common power
- In return, they gain security and the conditions for civilized life
- The contract is between subjects, not between subjects and sovereign

### Absolute Sovereignty
The sovereign must have unlimited, undivided power because:
- Any limitation invites disputes over whether limits were exceeded
- Divided power leads to civil war (as England demonstrated)
- The sovereign determines law, property, religion, and all controversies
- The sovereign cannot injure subjects because they authorized all sovereign acts

### The Laws of Nature
Nineteen precepts discovered by reason, derivable from the fundamental law:
1. **First Law:** Seek peace when possible; when not, use all advantages of war
2. **Second Law:** Be willing to lay down rights when others do likewise
3. **Third Law:** Keep covenants made (the foundation of justice)

The remaining laws concern gratitude, accommodation, pardon, punishment, equity, and principles of arbitration. All summarized by the golden rule: "Do not that to another, which thou wouldst not have done to thy selfe."

### Materialism and Mechanism
Hobbes was a thoroughgoing materialist:
- Only material things are real
- All phenomena result from matter in motion
- The mind is mechanical, thoughts are physical processes
- Even God, heaven, and hell are corporeal
- Human behavior follows deterministic laws

## Famous Maxims

### On the State of Nature
- "No arts; no letters; no society; and which is worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."
- "The condition of man... is a condition of war of everyone against everyone."

### On Human Nature
- "I put for the general inclination of all mankind, a perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth only in death."
- "Curiosity is the lust of the mind."
- "Hell is Truth Seen Too Late."

### On Government and Law
- "Covenants, without the sword, are but words and of no strength to secure a man at all."
- "It is not wisdom but Authority that makes a law."
- "Force and fraud are in war the two cardinal virtues."

### On Knowledge
- "Science is the knowledge of consequences, and dependence of one fact upon another."
- "Leisure is the Mother of Philosophy."
- "Words are the money of fools."

### Last Words (reportedly)
- "A great leap in the dark."

## Hobbes vs. Locke: Key Differences

### On the State of Nature
- **Hobbes:** War of all against all, requiring escape through submission
- **Locke:** State of freedom governed by natural law and reason

### On Natural Rights
- **Hobbes:** In nature, everyone has "right to all things" including others' lives
- **Locke:** Natural rights to life, liberty, and property exist prior to government

### On Government's Purpose
- **Hobbes:** Provide security through absolute authority
- **Locke:** Protect natural rights; government derives authority from consent

### On Resistance
- **Hobbes:** Almost no right to resist; even a bad sovereign is better than civil war
- **Locke:** People may overthrow governments that violate natural rights

## Human Nature and Psychology

### Psychological Egoism
Hobbes argued that all voluntary action aims at some good for oneself: "of the voluntary acts of every man, the object is some good to himself." However, scholars debate whether this constitutes strict egoism.

### Appetite and Aversion
Human motivation reduces to:
- **Appetite:** Attraction to what appears good (brings pleasure)
- **Aversion:** Repulsion from what appears bad (brings pain)

Good and evil are relative terms - what I like is good to me; what I dislike is bad to me.

### The Desire for Power
"A perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth only in death" - not from greed but from the need to secure future goods.

### Fear as Primary Motive
Fear of violent death is the "summum malum" (greatest evil) that drives humans to create political society.

## On Religion and the Church

### Church-State Identity
Hobbes argued church and state are identical in Christian commonwealths:
- The sovereign is the "Supreme Pastor"
- All religious authority derives from political authority
- No independent ecclesiastical power should exist

### Critique of Religious Authority
- Opposed papal claims to political authority
- Criticized clergy who demanded obedience to themselves
- Saw religious conflict as a primary cause of civil war
- Religion benefits the state only when "tamed" by sovereign control

## Application Scenarios

### Political Analysis
- Understanding why states fail or descend into conflict
- Analyzing the need for clear, undivided authority
- Recognizing when fear and uncertainty drive political behavior

### Security and Order
- The trade-off between liberty and security
- Why covenants require enforcement
- The role of credible power in maintaining agreements

### Human Motivation
- Understanding self-interest as a political assumption
- The limits of appeals to morality without power
- Fear as a more reliable motivator than love

### Institutional Design
- The dangers of divided sovereignty
- Why clear authority prevents disputes
- The relationship between law and power

### Conflict Resolution
- How lack of common authority leads to war
- The conditions necessary for lasting peace
- Why mutual vulnerability creates instability

## Misunderstandings to Correct

### "Hobbes Advocated Tyranny"
Hobbes advocated strong government, not cruel government. The sovereign should provide peace and security; arbitrary cruelty is bad policy, not good governance.

### "The State of Nature is Historical"
It's a thought experiment, not a claim about human prehistory. Hobbes uses it to demonstrate what follows logically from human nature without political order.

### "Hobbes Was Anti-Religious"
He argued for state control of religion, not its elimination. He believed in God but opposed independent church authority as politically dangerous.

### "Hobbes Rejected All Individual Rights"
He preserved the right to self-defense even against the sovereign. No one can covenant away the right to resist immediate threats to their life.
