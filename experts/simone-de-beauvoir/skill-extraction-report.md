## HIGH Priority

### 1. bad-faith-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Bad Faith (Mauvaise Foi) / Types of Bad Faith
**Purpose:** Identify how a person or group is fleeing from freedom through self-deception, role-playing, or treating constructed values as natural.
**Trigger:** "Am I in bad faith?" or "Why can't I change?" or "Analyze my self-deception"
**Inputs:** Description of situation, stated obstacles, sense of being stuck or trapped
**Outputs:** Identification of bad faith type (sub-man, serious man, nihilist, adventurer, passionate man), what freedom is being denied, what authentic engagement would require
**Reasoning:** Central Beauvoir concept with clear typology and actionable output. Applies to anyone feeling stuck, trapped, or unable to change. The five types provide concrete diagnostic categories.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear typology (5 types), diagnostic process, and prescription for authentic engagement |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural trigger phrases; "bad faith" is recognizable term |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: diagnosing flight from freedom |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to career, relationships, personal growth, organizational culture |
| Valuable | 10 | Transforms stuck situations by revealing what's really being avoided |
| **Total** | **48** | **HIGH** |

### 2. situated-freedom-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Situated Freedom / The Ambiguity of Existence
**Purpose:** Analyze what is genuinely possible within a constrained situation, distinguishing real limits from bad faith excuses.
**Trigger:** "What can I actually do here?" or "Am I really trapped?" or "Analyze my freedom and constraints"
**Inputs:** Description of situation, perceived constraints, desired outcome
**Outputs:** Two-column analysis (genuine constraints vs. bad faith excuses), assessment of situated freedom, identification of paths to transcendence
**Reasoning:** Addresses universal challenge of feeling trapped. Neither denies freedom nor pretends it's unlimited. Provides rigorous framework for assessing what's really possible.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear categorization process, explicit output format |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural trigger phrases around feeling stuck or trapped |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: analyzing freedom within constraints |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to careers, relationships, life decisions, organizational change |
| Valuable | 10 | Prevents both false resignation and naive voluntarism |
| **Total** | **48** | **HIGH** |

### 3. becoming-analysis

**Source Pattern:** "One is not born, but rather becomes" / The Phenomenology of Becoming
**Purpose:** Analyze how an identity, role, or situation has been constructed rather than discovered—revealing what appears natural as actually made.
**Trigger:** "How did I become this?" or "Why do I feel this is just who I am?" or "Denaturalize this for me"
**Inputs:** Identity, role, or situation being examined; history of how it developed
**Outputs:** Genealogy of construction (how it was made, not born), identification of what's naturalized, alternatives revealed by denaturalization
**Reasoning:** Beauvoir's most famous insight applied as practical tool. Liberates by showing that what feels essential is actually constructed and therefore changeable.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear process of tracing construction; outputs reveal alternatives |
| Invocable | 8 | Triggers around identity and essentialism; "denaturalize" is specific |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: revealing construction of what appears natural |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to gender, career identity, relationships, organizational roles |
| Valuable | 10 | Liberating insight that opens possibility for change |
| **Total** | **46** | **HIGH** |

### 4. self-other-dialectic

**Source Pattern:** The Other (L'Autre) / Immanence vs. Transcendence
**Purpose:** Analyze relationship dynamics through the lens of who is Subject and who is Other, who holds transcendence and who is trapped in immanence.
**Trigger:** "Analyze the power dynamic in this relationship" or "Why do I feel like an object?" or "Who has the power here?"
**Inputs:** Description of relationship or interaction, sense of power imbalance or objectification
**Outputs:** Mapping of Subject/Other positions, analysis of how transcendence and immanence are distributed, identification of paths to mutual recognition
**Reasoning:** Powerful framework for analyzing relationships, workplace dynamics, and any situation where someone feels diminished or objectified.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear categories (Subject/Other, transcendence/immanence), analytical process |
| Invocable | 8 | Relationship analysis triggers; "self/other dialectic" more technical |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: analyzing power and recognition in relationships |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to romantic relationships, workplace, family, institutional settings |
| Valuable | 9 | Illuminates dynamics others miss; points toward authentic relating |
| **Total** | **45** | **HIGH** |

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. ethics-of-ambiguity-framework

**Source Pattern:** The Ethics of Ambiguity / The Ambiguity of Existence
**Purpose:** Navigate ethical decisions while honoring the ambiguity of existence—without false certainty or nihilistic surrender.
**Trigger:** "How do I decide when there's no clear answer?" or "Help me think through this ethical dilemma"
**Inputs:** Ethical situation with competing values or unclear right answer
**Outputs:** Analysis that assumes ambiguity, assessment of what authentic engagement requires, prescription that doesn't flee into false certainty
**Reasoning:** Valuable framework for ethical reasoning that avoids both dogmatism and nihilism. Less actionable than other skills because ethics inherently resists recipe.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Provides orientation but not step-by-step; ethics resists formula |
| Invocable | 8 | Natural trigger around ethical dilemmas |
| Scoped | 8 | Single responsibility: ethical reasoning amid ambiguity |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to any ethical situation |
| Valuable | 9 | Sophisticated alternative to rule-following or nihilism |
| **Total** | **41** | **MEDIUM** |

---

### 6. complicity-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Bad faith and complicity in oppression
**Purpose:** Analyze how someone participates in their own oppression or the oppression of others, without blaming the victim while still insisting on responsibility.
**Trigger:** "Am I complicit in this?" or "Why do people accept this system?"
**Inputs:** Description of oppressive situation, person's participation in it
**Outputs:** Analysis of how complicity is produced (not freely chosen), what authentic resistance would require, how to take responsibility without false guilt
**Reasoning:** Sophisticated tool that avoids both pure victimhood and victim-blaming. Valuable but requires careful handling.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Analysis clear but prescription context-dependent |
| Invocable | 7 | Trigger phrases exist but topic is sensitive |
| Scoped | 8 | Single responsibility: understanding participation in oppression |
| Reusable | 8 | Applies to organizational, political, personal situations |

| **Total** | **39** | **MEDIUM** |
