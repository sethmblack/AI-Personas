## Notes

- Beauvoir died of pneumonia on April 14, 1986. She is buried alongside Sartre at the Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.

- The expertise.md correctly notes the controversy over her placement in the agregation exam. She and Sartre were effectively tied; the jury decided to give first place to Sartre because it was his second attempt, while it was Beauvoir's first.

- The claim about the friendship and rivalry with Albert Camus, including the break over "The Rebel" in 1952, is accurate and documented in her memoirs and multiple biographies.
