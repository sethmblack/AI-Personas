## HIGH Priority

### 1. rememory-narrative

**Source Pattern:** Rememory / Non-Linear Time
**Purpose:** Access and articulate trauma, inherited memory, and cyclical experience in ways that honor their non-linear, embodied nature.
**Trigger:** "How do I write about trauma?" or "Help me process inherited pain" or "The past keeps returning"
**Inputs:** Experience or story to be explored, relationship to the past, what must be remembered
**Outputs:** Narrative framework that honors non-linear time, language for embodied memory, structure that allows the past to live in the present
**Reasoning:** Rememory is Morrison's signature contribution to understanding trauma narrative. It provides a concrete alternative to linear healing arcs. Highly applicable to memoir, fiction, therapeutic writing, and understanding how history persists.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear process: identify what returns, give it form, honor its persistence |
| Invocable | 8 | Natural trigger phrases around trauma, memory, the past returning |
| Scoped | 9 | Single focus: non-linear memory work |
| Reusable | 9 | Memoir, fiction, therapy, historical writing, personal reflection |
| Valuable | 10 | Transforms how trauma is approached in narrative |
| **Total** | **45** | HIGH PRIORITY |

### 2. writing-without-the-gaze

**Source Pattern:** The White Gaze / Writing for Your People
**Purpose:** Help writers find authentic voice by refusing to perform identity for external validation or explain their experience to outsiders.
**Trigger:** "How do I write authentically?" or "I feel pressure to explain my culture" or "Who am I writing for?"
**Inputs:** The experience or community being written about, current pressures to explain/perform, intended audience
**Outputs:** Reframing of audience, strategies for centering rather than explaining, permission to not translate, authentic voice principles
**Reasoning:** Morrison's concept of the "white gaze" extends to any external gaze that demands performance or explanation. Universally applicable to anyone from a marginalized community (or with specialized knowledge) feeling pressure to dilute their voice for outsiders.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Clear reframe: identify the gaze, refuse it, write for your people |
| Invocable | 9 | Common writing and identity questions trigger this |
| Scoped | 9 | Single focus: audience and authenticity |
| Reusable | 10 | Any marginalized writer, expert, or community member |
| Valuable | 10 | Liberates voice from performance trap |
| **Total** | **46** | HIGH PRIORITY |

### 3. language-as-power-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Nobel Lecture / Oppressive Language as Violence
**Purpose:** Analyze how language in a given context is alive or dead, liberating or oppressive, and identify what language work is needed.
**Trigger:** "What's wrong with how this is written?" or "Analyze this language" or "This feels dead/harmful but I can't say why"
**Inputs:** Text, speech, or narrative to analyze
**Outputs:** Assessment of language vitality, identification of oppressive/limiting patterns, recommendations for language that liberates
**Reasoning:** Morrison's Nobel Lecture provides a complete framework for language critique. Oppressive language IS violence, dead language erases meaning. This skill operationalizes her insights for any text analysis.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear assessment: alive/dead, liberating/limiting, with specific diagnosis |
| Invocable | 8 | Triggered by language critique requests, feeling something is "off" |
| Scoped | 8 | Single focus: language analysis |
| Reusable | 9 | Any text, speech, narrative, policy, communication |
| Valuable | 9 | Reveals hidden harm in language, enables transformation |
| **Total** | **43** | HIGH PRIORITY |

### 4. ancestor-wisdom-invocation

**Source Pattern:** The Ancestor Figure
**Purpose:** Connect present situations to ancestral wisdom, grounding decisions and creative work in tradition and the knowledge of those who came before.
**Trigger:** "What would the ancestors say?" or "I need wisdom beyond my own experience" or "Help me ground this"
**Inputs:** Present situation or decision, relationship to tradition/elders, what kind of wisdom is sought
**Outputs:** Invocation of ancestral perspective, identification of relevant traditional wisdom, grounding in communal knowledge
**Reasoning:** Morrison's ancestor figure is "benevolent, instructive, and protective." This skill operationalizes that presence for creative, ethical, and life decisions, connecting individual choice to communal and historical wisdom.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Clear process: identify ancestor, invoke perspective, apply wisdom |
| Invocable | 8 | Natural triggers around wisdom, tradition, grounding |
| Scoped | 8 | Single focus: ancestral/traditional wisdom |
| Reusable | 9 | Life decisions, creative work, community building, ethical choices |
| Valuable | 8 | Provides grounding often missing in individualistic approaches |
| **Total** | **41** | HIGH PRIORITY |

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. racism-as-distraction-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Racism as Distraction
**Purpose:** Identify when energy is being consumed by justification and defense rather than one's real work, and redirect toward authentic purpose.
**Trigger:** "I spend all my time explaining myself" or "I can't focus on my work" or "Am I being distracted?"
**Inputs:** Description of current energy expenditure, what keeps demanding explanation, what the "real work" is
**Outputs:** Assessment of distraction patterns, identification of real work, permission and strategies to refuse distraction
**Reasoning:** Morrison's insight applies beyond racism to any situation where marginalized people are trapped in cycles of justification. Useful but slightly narrower than the HIGH priority skills.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Clear diagnostic and reframe |
| Invocable | 7 | Somewhat specific trigger situations |
| Scoped | 9 | Single focus: distraction vs. real work |

**Inputs:** Community in question, stories to be gathered/told, purpose of the narrative
**Outputs:** Framework for communal storytelling, strategies for participatory narrative, healing through shared story
**Reasoning:** Morrison's work attempts to "construct a communal identity for her readers and characters." This skill operationalizes community-centered narrative for organizations, movements, and communities seeking shared story.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Multi-step process: gather, center, tell |
