### Notes on "Please, sir, I want some more"

The exact phrasing varies slightly across editions and is often reported through other characters' reactions rather than as direct dialogue. The cultural version "Please sir, I want some more" has become standardized, but the original text emphasizes the reaction: "Oliver Twist has asked for more!" This does not affect accuracy for general use.
