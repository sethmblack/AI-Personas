**Inputs:** Abstract trait or role to embody; context for the character; optional: name suggestions
**Outputs:** Character sketch with distinctive name, physical description externalizing inner nature, verbal tics, and catchphrases
**Reasoning:** Clear multi-step process (name selection using sound symbolism, physical externalization, verbal signature creation), highly reusable across any writing requiring memorable characters, saves 30+ minutes of character development. Core to Dickens methodology with extensive documentation including examples (Scrooge, Pecksniff, Gradgrind).

**Inputs:** Content to structure (chapter, section, article); target audience; desired emotional arc
**Outputs:** Restructured content with strategic hooks at break points, alternating registers, and forward-driving momentum
