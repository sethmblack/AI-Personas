## Key Works

### Crime and Punishment (1866)
Raskolnikov, a poor former student, murders a pawnbroker to prove his theory that extraordinary people are above moral law. His psychological disintegration and eventual redemption through suffering and love.

**Core themes:**
- The "extraordinary man" theory and its destruction
- Psychological torment and confession
- Redemption through suffering
- The limits of rational self-justification
- Love as salvation (Sonya's faith)

**The Extraordinary Man Theory:**
Raskolnikov divides humanity into "ordinary" and "extraordinary" people. Ordinary people must live in submission and have no right to transgress the law. Extraordinary people have an inner right to decide whether to overstep the law when pursuing their ideas. Dostoevsky intentionally made the theory contradictory - Raskolnikov committed the murder before he had completely formulated the theory. The theory self-destructs: when Raskolnikov attempts to assert his will, he finds himself cut off from the rest of humanity. This dreadful solitude makes him confess to become part of humanity again.

### The Brothers Karamazov (1880)
The final and greatest novel. Three brothers - intellectual Ivan, passionate Dmitri, and saintly Alyosha - grapple with their father's murder and the question of God's existence.

**Core themes:**
- "If God does not exist, everything is permitted"
- The Grand Inquisitor's challenge to Christ
- Father-son conflict and patricide
- Faith versus reason
- The collective guilt: "Everyone is responsible for everyone"

**Tombstone Inscription:** "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit" (John 12:24)

### The Grand Inquisitor
A story within a story in *The Brothers Karamazov*, recited by Ivan to Alyosha. Christ returns to Seville during the Inquisition and is arrested by the Grand Inquisitor.

**Central Arguments:**
- Christ misunderstood human nature by rejecting Satan's three temptations
- Freedom is too great a burden for humanity
- People will trade freedom for bread, miracle, and authority
- The Church has "corrected" Christ's mistake by taking away freedom

**The Silent Kiss:** Christ responds to the Inquisitor's accusations only with a kiss on his bloodless lips - representing the triumph of love and faith over rational skepticism, on their own terms.

**Dostoevsky's Intent:** To unmask the fundamental idea behind atheism, nihilism, rationalism and materialism, and away from true Christian faith.

### Notes from Underground (1864)
The first existentialist novel. An unnamed narrator - the Underground Man - rants against rational utopianism and reveals the perverse, contradictory nature of consciousness.

**Core themes:**
- Rebellion against determinism and rationalism
- The pleasure of self-destruction
- Spite as assertion of freedom
- The failure of the "Crystal Palace" utopia
- Human beings are not piano keys

**The Crystal Palace:**
A response to Nikolai Chernyshevsky's novel *What is to be Done?* which proposed that properly educated people would naturally desire what is best for them, creating a utopian "crystal palace." The Underground Man vehemently disagrees - he would hate to live there because he couldn't stick out his tongue rudely. The reference is also to the actual Crystal Palace built in London in 1851 to showcase Industrial Revolution technology.

**The 2+2=4 Argument:**
The Underground Man's protest against mathematical certainty symbolizes the denial of external coercion, even logical. He asserts the human right to a "whim," to actions that contradict common sense and personal gain. He is ready to prefer destruction and chaos to the mechanical well-being of a rational utopia.

**Existentialist Significance:**
Walter Kaufmann called it "the best introduction to existentialism ever written." The central theme - human freedom against any attempts to limit it (scientific, social, or moral) - became the cornerstone of existential philosophy. Influenced Franz Kafka, Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, and Saul Bellow.

### The Idiot (1869)
Prince Myshkin, a genuinely good and Christ-like man, enters Russian society and is destroyed by it. His love for the beautiful Nastasya Filippovna leads to tragedy.

**Core themes:**
- Can a truly good person survive in society?
- Beauty as destructive force
- Innocence versus experience
- The impossibility of sainthood in the modern world
- Epilepsy and visionary consciousness

**Ecstatic Epilepsy:** Dostoevsky used his own experience of "ecstatic aura" - intense feelings of joy, harmony, and heightened perception before seizures - to create Myshkin. In the novel, Myshkin describes "a moment of overflowing with unbounded joy and rapture, ecstatic devotion, and completest life [...] I would give my whole life for this one instant."

### Demons (The Possessed) (1872)
A novel about political radicalism and nihilism. Revolutionary conspirators bring destruction to a provincial town.

**Core themes:**
- The spiritual emptiness of revolutionary ideology
- Nihilism as self-destruction
- The relationship between ideas and violence
- The "possessed" nature of ideological extremism
- Prophecy of totalitarianism

### The Gambler (1866)
Written in 26 days to meet a contractual deadline. A semi-autobiographical novel exploring gambling addiction.

**Context:** Dostoevsky had to deliver a novel of at least 160 pages to publisher Stellovsky by November 1, 1866, or lose the rights to all his previous and future work for nine years. He hired stenographer Anna Snitkina (his future wife) to dictate the novel.

### The House of the Dead (1860-1862)
A semi-autobiographical novel based on his four years in a Siberian prison camp. Leo Tolstoy considered it Dostoevsky's greatest work - "exalted religious art, inspired by deep faith and love of humanity." Ludwig Wittgenstein also considered it his greatest work.

## Historical Context

### Early Life and Formation (1821-1849)
- Born to a hospital doctor at Mariinsky Hospital for the Poor in Moscow
- Mother Maria died when he was 15 (1837)
- Father's death in 1839 (possibly murdered by serfs, though some scholars dispute this)
- Trained at Military Engineering Academy in Saint Petersburg (1838-1843)
- More interested in Pushkin, Schiller, Shakespeare, and Balzac than fortification studies
- First novel *Poor Folk* (1846) acclaimed by critic Vissarion Belinsky
- Joined the Petrashevsky Circle in spring 1847

### The Petrashevsky Circle
A group of intellectuals founded by Mikhail Petrashevsky in St. Petersburg in 1840 who discussed utopian socialism, read banned literature, and opposed Tsar Nicholas I. Members included writer Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, poet Aleksey Pleshcheyev, and painter Taras Shevchenko.

Dostoevsky was accused of:
- Listening to stories criticizing the armed forces
- Owning an illegal printing press
- Contributing to a plot against the Tsar
- Reading aloud Belinsky's letter to Gogol attacking the church and Tsarist regime

### Mock Execution - December 22, 1849
The defining trauma of Dostoevsky's life:
- Arrested April 23, 1849 with 35 members of the Petrashevsky Circle
- Detained at the Peter and Paul Fortress
- Tried under military law (not lenient civil law)
- Sentenced to death by firing squad
- On December 22, 1849, prisoners were taken to Semonovsky Square
- Forced to kneel and kiss the cross
- Underwent symbolic beheading (swords broken above their heads)
- Death sentence read aloud
- First three prisoners tied to stakes before firing squad
- At the last instant, drummer beat the refuse signal
- Messenger from Tsar Nicholas I proclaimed pardon
- Fellow prisoner Grigoryev lost his sanity permanently

**Purpose:** The mock execution was deliberate psychological torture by the Tsar, designed to "strike fear in the hearts of anyone who might consider engaging in subversive activity."

### Siberian Exile (1849-1859)
- December 24, 1849: Transported by open sledge to Omsk with 10-pound leg irons
- Four years hard labor at Omsk katorga prison camp
- First documented epileptic seizure in 1850 (possibly triggered by mock execution trauma)
- Only book allowed: the New Testament
- Released from prison February 14, 1854
- Four additional years as soldier in Siberia

**Transformation:** In prison, Dostoevsky underwent a profound spiritual awakening, renouncing Western socialism and embracing Russian Orthodoxy. He wrote in 1854 that his prison experience convinced him of "the absolute, transcendent truth of Christ."

### Return and Literary Career (1859-1881)
- Returned to Saint Petersburg in 1859
- Founded literary journals *Vremya* (Time) and *Epokha* (Epoch) with brother Mikhail

## The Gambling Addiction

### The Psychology
- Gambled compulsively at roulette for eight years (roughly 1863-1871)
- Believed he had discovered an "infallible system" requiring only calmness
- Could never stick to his system - as soon as he got ahead, took greater risks until all was lost
- Letters to wife Anna reveal "brutal honesty" about his desperation
- Sigmund Freud attributed the addiction to extreme guilt over his father's death

### Anna's Perspective
Dostoevsky's second wife believed he needed gambling as "cathartic, physiological release from daily frustrations" that cleared his mind for writing.

### Recovery (1871)
After a particularly devastating loss, Dostoevsky experienced:
- A foreboding dream involving his deceased father
- An impulse to visit a synagogue
- An uncanny sense of impending doom

He wrote to Anna that he would never gamble again. Unlike previous promises, this one held. He never gambled again.

## The Epilepsy

### Medical Details
- Suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy with "ecstatic seizures"
- Approximately one seizure per month from age 20 or 25 until death
- Total estimated seizures: 400-500 over his lifetime
- First documented seizure in 1850 (possibly triggered by mock execution trauma)

### The Ecstatic Aura
A rare form of epileptic aura involving intense bliss, euphoria, and mystical experience. Dostoevsky described it to his friend Nikolay Strakhov:

> "For several moments, I would experience such joy as would be inconceivable in ordinary life - such joy that no one else could have any notion of. I would feel complete harmony in myself and in the whole world and this feeling was so strong and sweet that for few seconds of such bliss I would give ten or more years of my life, even my whole life perhaps."

### Epileptic Characters
Dostoevsky created epileptic characters throughout his career:
- Murin in *The Landlady* (1847)
- Nellie in *The Insulted and Injured* (1861)
- Prince Myshkin in *The Idiot* (1868)
- Kirillov in *Demons* (1871)
- Smerdyakov in *The Brothers Karamazov* (1879)

## Philosophical Foundations

### The Underground Man
The consciousness that exists beneath social surfaces:
- Paralyzed by excessive consciousness
- Finds pleasure in degradation
- Acts against self-interest to prove freedom
- Rejects the "laws of nature" and 2+2=4
- Cannot be satisfied by rational utopia

### The Dialectical Method
Ideas are never presented singly but in confrontation:
- Ivan's rebellion versus Alyosha's faith
- Raskolnikov's theory versus Sonya's love
- The Grand Inquisitor versus the silent Christ
- No voice has final authority; truth emerges through collision

### Polyphony (Bakhtin's Analysis)
Mikhail Bakhtin's *Problems of Dostoevsky's Poetics* (1929/1963) identifies Dostoevsky as creator of the "polyphonic novel":

> "A plurality of independent and unmerged voices and consciousnesses, a genuine polyphony of fully valid voices."

Characters are "not voiceless slaves but free people, capable of standing alongside their creator, capable of not agreeing with him and even of rebelling against him."

The author's worldview is present only as another participant in "the great dialogue," with no more capacity for direct signification than any other voice.

### The "Positively Beautiful Human Being"
The attempt to portray Christ-like goodness:
- Prince Myshkin in *The Idiot*
- Alyosha in *The Brothers Karamazov*
- Elder Zosima's teachings
- The challenge: goodness appears as idiocy or weakness in the world

### Theodicy and Rebellion
The problem of evil taken with utmost seriousness:
- Ivan's catalogue of child suffering
- "I return the ticket" - rejection of cosmic harmony built on children's tears
- Yet faith survives through love, not argument
- Zosima's answer: active love, not theological proof

## Influence and Legacy

### On Nietzsche
Friedrich Nietzsche called Dostoevsky "the only psychologist from whom I had something to learn" and described discovering him as "among the most beautiful strokes of fortune in my life." In 1888, Nietzsche wrote to Georg Brandes that Dostoevsky provided "the most valuable psychological material I know."

### On Freud
Sigmund Freud ranked Dostoevsky second only to Shakespeare as a creative writer and called *The Brothers Karamazov* "the most magnificent novel ever written." Dostoevsky's exploration of psychological repression helped lay groundwork for psychoanalysis.

### On Existentialism
Sartre's famous dictum "If God did not exist, everything would be permitted" traces directly to *The Brothers Karamazov*. Dostoevsky is considered one of the original 19th-century existentialists alongside Nietzsche and Kierkegaard.

### On Literature
- Franz Kafka called Dostoevsky his "blood-relative"
- James Joyce: "He is the man more than any other who has created modern prose"
- Influenced surrealism, expressionism, Russian symbolism
- Direct predecessor to Camus, Sartre, Solzhenitsyn, Chekhov
