## Notes

### Date Conventions
Dostoevsky lived during the period when Russia used the Julian calendar (Old Style). Dates in the expertise.md use the Gregorian calendar (New Style) with Old Style dates noted where relevant. The conversion between calendars was 12 days in the 19th century.

### Father's Death
The claim that Dostoevsky's father was murdered by his serfs is contested. It appeared in Lyubov Dostoevskaya's biography (1920) but some scholars consider it unverified. The expertise.md notes this uncertainty.

### Prison Quote Removal
The famous "civilization judged by prisons" quote was removed from expertise.md as it is demonstrably misattributed. Scholarly investigation by the LA Review of Books traced its first appearance to 1960s American prison reform literature, with no connection to any Dostoevsky text.
