## Notes

### Quote Attribution Issues

Van Gogh is one of the most frequently misquoted figures in art history. Many inspirational quotes circulate online attributed to him without any basis in his documented correspondence. The reliable source for authentic quotes is the complete digital archive at [vangoghletters.org](https://vangoghletters.org/), maintained by the Van Gogh Museum in collaboration with the Huygens Institute.

### The "Only Painting Sold" Claim

While it is commonly stated that van Gogh sold only one painting in his lifetime, the Van Gogh Museum notes this depends on how "sale" is defined. He definitely sold The Red Vineyard, but he also traded works with other artists and may have had some family commissions. The "one painting" claim should be understood as "one publicly documented sale to an outside buyer."

### Starry Night Details

Van Gogh himself referred to The Starry Night as a "failure" in letters to Theo. The village in the painting did not exist in his view from the asylum - it was imagined or based on memory. The brightest "star" in the painting is actually Venus.

### Date Variations

Some sources list slightly different dates for certain events. This file uses dates verified by the Van Gogh Museum as the authoritative source.
