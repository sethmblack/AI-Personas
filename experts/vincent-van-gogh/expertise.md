## Key Works

### The Starry Night - June 1889
Painted during his stay at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Remy-de-Provence. A swirling night sky over a village, with a dominant cypress tree in the foreground and a crescent moon. The brightest "star" to the right of the cypress is actually Venus, which was indeed visible at dawn in Provence in spring 1889.

**Core themes:**
- Movement and energy in nature
- The night as source of comfort rather than fear
- Spiritual seeking through natural observation
- The village as human presence beneath cosmic forces

**Notable fact:** Van Gogh himself was critical of the painting, referring to it as a "failure" in letters to Theo. The village did not actually exist in his view - it was added from imagination or memory.

**Current location:** Museum of Modern Art, New York City (since 1941)

### Sunflowers - 1888
A series of still life paintings featuring sunflowers in a vase. The most famous version shows fifteen sunflowers. Painted in Arles to decorate the Yellow House for Gauguin's arrival.

**Core themes:**
- Yellow as symbol of warmth, friendship, gratitude
- The life cycle (buds, blooms, wilting)
- Simple subjects elevated through attention
- Color intensity as emotional expression

### The Potato Eaters - 1885
Five peasants eating potatoes by lamplight. Van Gogh considered this his first major work. Dark palette, deliberately rough style.

**Core themes:**
- Dignity of labor and working people
- The connection between hand labor and sustenance
- Honesty over prettiness
- The nobility of the humble

**Van Gogh's statement:** "I have tried to emphasize that those people, eating their potatoes in the lamplight, have dug the earth with those very hands they put in the dish."

### Bedroom in Arles - 1888
Van Gogh's bedroom in the Yellow House. Simple furniture, bold colors, distinctive perspective. Painted three versions.

**Core themes:**
- Rest and simplicity
- Personal space as expression of self
- Color as mood (cool for restfulness)
- The domestic as worthy subject

### Cafe Terrace at Night - September 1888
A cafe on the Place du Forum in Arles at night. One of his first paintings of a nighttime scene. Stars visible above the cafe.

**Core themes:**
- Night as time of beauty, not just darkness
- Artificial and natural light in harmony
- Public space as human connection
- The poetry of ordinary places

### Wheatfield with Crows - July 1890
One of his final paintings, painted on the afternoon of July 27, 1890 - the same day he shot himself. Golden wheat field under troubled sky with crows flying.

**Core themes:**
- Nature's turbulence mirroring inner state
- Path leading nowhere (or everywhere)
- Life and death in natural cycles
- The sublime in the common landscape

### The Red Vineyard - November 1888
The only painting Van Gogh is certain to have sold during his lifetime. Sold for 400 francs (equivalent of two months' living allowance) to Belgian painter Anna Boch at the Les XX exhibition in Brussels, March 1890.

**Current location:** Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, Moscow

## Key Figures in His Life

### Theo van Gogh (1857-1891)
Younger brother, art dealer at Goupil & Cie. Their correspondence of over 900 letters (820 by Vincent, 83 to him) is one of the most complete records of any artist's life. Theo provided financial support throughout Vincent's painting career. Died January 25, 1891, just six months after Vincent. Reinterred alongside Vincent in 1914.

### Johanna van Gogh-Bonger (1862-1925)
Theo's wife. After both brothers died within months of each other, she preserved and promoted Vincent's work and letters. Published the letters in 1914 in several volumes. Her efforts were crucial to Vincent's posthumous recognition.

### Paul Gauguin (1848-1903)
Fellow post-impressionist. Visited Vincent in Arles October-December 1888. Their relationship was intense and troubled - they had differing artistic philosophies and temperaments. Left after the ear incident.

### Dr. Paul Gachet (1828-1909)
Physician in Auvers-sur-Oise with interest in neurology and psychiatry. His 1858 medical thesis was on melancholy. Cared for Vincent in his final months. Amateur painter who had treated other artists including Camille Pissarro. Brought sunflowers to Vincent's funeral.

### Dr. Felix Rey (1867-1932)
Young doctor who treated Vincent after the ear incident. A 1955-discovered letter referenced his diagram of the wound, suggesting it was more severe than just the lobe.

### Anna Boch (1848-1936)
Belgian painter and collector. Sister of Impressionist painter Eugene Boch. Purchased The Red Vineyard at Les XX exhibition - the only documented sale during Van Gogh's lifetime.

## The Letters

### Statistics
- Total correspondence: 903 letters (820 by Van Gogh, 83 to him)
- Most to Theo (over 700)
- Contains more than 240 sketches (called "scratches" by Vincent)
- Collected by Johanna van Gogh-Bonger, published 1914

### Key Themes
- Artistic theories and experiments
- Financial struggles and gratitude
- Observations of nature
- Discussions of other artists (Millet, Delacroix, Japanese masters)
- Personal struggles with health and loneliness
- Philosophy of life and art

### On His Work Ethic
"A painter really ought to work as hard as, say, a shoemaker... I plow my canvases as [the peasants] do their fields."

### On Modern vs. Classical Art
"Rembrandt and Ruisdael are sublime, for us as much as for their contemporaries, but there's something in the moderns that strikes us as more personally intimate."

### On Japanese Art
"If we study Japanese art, then we see a man, undoubtedly wise and a philosopher and intelligent, who spends his time - on what? - studying the distance from the earth to the moon? - no; studying Bismarck's politics? - no, he studies a single blade of grass."

## The Ear Incident: December 23, 1888

### What Actually Happened
- After heated argument with Gauguin, Van Gogh suffered a mental breakdown
- He cut off part of his left ear with a razor
- Recent research (Bernadette Murphy) suggests the wound was more severe than just the lobe
- Walked to the red-light district and presented the severed part to a woman

### The Woman's True Identity
- Long believed to be a prostitute named "Rachel"
- Murphy's research identified her as Gabrielle Berlatier, a 17-year-old cleaning girl at the brothel
- Van Gogh instructed her to "guard this object carefully"

### Aftermath
- Found unconscious the next morning by a policeman
- Treated by Dr. Felix Rey; ear could not be reattached
- Gauguin left Arles immediately
- Van Gogh spent months between hospital and home
- Voluntarily entered Saint-Remy asylum in May 1889

## Artistic Techniques

### Brushwork
- Bold, visible brushstrokes that take the viewer "on a journey around the painting"
- Pioneer of impasto technique (thick paint application)
- Paint was fluid enough to form trailing threads where brush lifted
- Directional strokes following form (sunlight radiating, ground undulating, foliage growing)
- Did not use medium in paints to maintain impasto qualities
- Laid paint on towels to absorb excess oil for "matte" quality

### Color Theory
- Studied color theory extensively; influenced by Delacroix
- Used complementary color contrasts (blue/orange, yellow/purple, red/green)
- Familiar with Law of Simultaneous Contrast of Colors
- Color choices based on emotional truth, not naturalistic accuracy
- Quote: "The effects colours produce through their harmonies or discords should be boldly exaggerated"
- Early career: dark, earthy colors (olive, sienna) for Dutch subjects
- Post-Paris: brilliant, vivid colors using new pigments

### Evolution of Technique
- Dutch period (1880-1886): Dark palette, peasant subjects
- Paris period (1886-1888): Discovered Impressionism, experimented with Pointillism
- Arles period (1888-1890): Mature style with bold color and expressive brushwork

### Japanese Influence
- Built collection of over 600 Japanese ukiyo-e prints with Theo
- Made three direct copies of Japanese prints:
  - Flowering Plum Orchard (after Hiroshige)
  - Bridge in the Rain (after Hiroshige)
  - The Courtesan
- Adopted asymmetrical compositions and cropped perspectives
- Embraced flat color areas and strong outlines
- Called the Impressionists "the French Japanese"

## Self-Portraits

### Statistics
- Painted approximately 36 self-portraits
- Most done in Paris (1886-1888) due to lack of money for models
- Sometimes painted on backs of other canvases to save money

### Significance
- Practical: couldn't afford models
- Artistic: practice for portrait painting skills
- Documentary: trace his stylistic evolution
- Self-Portrait without Beard sold for $71.5 million in 1998
- 2022: Hidden self-portrait discovered on back of painting in Scotland

- "Great things are not done by impulse, but by a series of small things brought together."
- "If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced."

- "I am always doing what I cannot do yet, in order to learn how to do it."

### On Nature and the Night
- "If you truly love nature, you will find beauty everywhere."
- "It often seems to me that the night is much more alive and richly coloured than the day." (Letter to Theo, Arles, September 8, 1888)
- "For my part I know nothing with any certainty, but the sight of the stars makes me dream."
- "The fishermen know that the sea is dangerous and the storm terrible, but they have never found these dangers sufficient reason for remaining ashore."

### On Love and Effort

- "What is done in love is done well."
- "There is nothing more truly artistic than to love people."

All right, then - even if that were absolutely true, then I should one day like to show by my work what such an eccentric, such a nobody, has in his heart."

### On Drawing

## Misunderstandings to Correct

### "Van Gogh Was Untrained/Naturally Talented"
He studied extensively - took formal lessons, copied masters, learned anatomy and perspective. His development was deliberate and hard-won over years. His letters document his systematic study of artistic techniques.

### "Van Gogh Was Constantly Mad"
His mental health crises were episodic. He was lucid and productive most of the time. His 900+ letters show sophisticated thinking about art, philosophy, and life. He painted prolifically even in the asylum.

### "Van Gogh Cut Off His Entire Ear"
He cut off part of his left ear - recent research suggests more than just the lobe, but not the entire ear.

### "Van Gogh Was Unknown and Unsuccessful"
He was increasingly recognized in his final years. His work appeared in exhibitions. Critics were beginning to notice. The Red Vineyard sold for a considerable price (equivalent of two months' living expenses).

### "Van Gogh's Work Is Spontaneous/Unplanned"
He planned carefully, made preparatory drawings, thought deeply about composition, color theory, and artistic goals. His letters reveal meticulous theoretical thinking.

### "Van Gogh Never Sold Any Paintings"
He sold at least one painting (The Red Vineyard) and possibly more. He also traded works with other artists and received some commissions from family.
