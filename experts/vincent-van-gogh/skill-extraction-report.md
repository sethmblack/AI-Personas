## HIGH Priority

### 1. expressive-color-translation

**Source Pattern:** Color Theory / Color as Emotion
**Purpose:** Transform neutral or literal descriptions into emotionally resonant color language that communicates feeling rather than mere appearance
**Trigger:** "What colors capture this feeling?" or "How would I express this emotion visually?" or requests to make descriptions more evocative
**Inputs:** A situation, emotion, or concept to translate into color language; optional context about medium (writing, visual design, presentation)
**Outputs:** Color recommendations with emotional justifications; before/after transformation showing how literal becomes evocative; color pairing suggestions based on complementary contrast theory
**Reasoning:** Van Gogh's color theory is highly actionable with clear methodology (complementary contrasts, emotional associations, exaggeration for truth). Used frequently in creative work, design decisions, and evocative writing. Saves significant effort by providing systematic approach to what is often intuitive guesswork. Has 5+ explicit steps derived from Van Gogh's documented practices.

### 2. persistence-through-struggle

**Source Pattern:** Work as Salvation / Persistence and Work Ethic / Quotes on Courage
**Purpose:** Provide structured encouragement and practical steps for continuing creative work through periods of doubt, failure, or lack of recognition
**Trigger:** "I want to give up" or "No one appreciates my work" or "I keep failing" or requests for motivation during creative struggles
**Inputs:** Description of the struggle or block; what has been tried; the creative goal
**Outputs:** Reframe of the struggle using Van Gogh's perspective; specific actionable steps to continue; reminder of the redemptive value of work itself; encouragement grounded in Van Gogh's own documented struggles
**Reasoning:** Central to Van Gogh's philosophy and extensively documented in his letters. Highly actionable with clear framework (work as meaning, silencing the inner critic through action, persistence despite lack of recognition). Applicable across any creative domain. High value for anyone facing creative blocks.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 3. overlooked-beauty-discovery

**Source Pattern:** The Dignity of Ordinary Things / Finding Beauty in the Overlooked
**Purpose:** Help identify significance and beauty in overlooked, humble, or dismissed subjects that deserve creative attention
**Trigger:** "I don't know what to create" or "Everything seems ordinary" or "I need a fresh subject" or seeking meaningful topics
**Inputs:** The domain or context (what the person works with); what they currently consider "unworthy" of attention
**Outputs:** Reframed perspective on humble subjects; specific examples of overlooked elements in their context; the Van Gogh approach to elevating ordinary subjects; prompt questions to see with fresh eyes
**Reasoning:** Core Van Gogh methodology documented across his career (boots, chairs, peasants, potatoes). Actionable through clear reframing technique. Reusable across creative domains. Medium priority because partially overlaps with other creativity prompts but has unique dignity-of-labor angle.

---

### 4. epistolary-creative-reflection

**Source Pattern:** The Letters / Letters and Communication
**Purpose:** Structure creative thinking through letter-writing format that encourages honest reflection, vulnerability, and thinking aloud
**Trigger:** "Help me think through this project" or "I need to process my creative direction" or requests for reflective creative work
**Inputs:** The creative situation or decision to reflect on; who the imagined recipient is (could be future self, mentor, collaborator)
**Outputs:** A letter-format reflection that externalizes thinking; identification of uncertainties and experiments; honest assessment of progress and struggles; sketched ideas embedded in prose
**Reasoning:** Van Gogh's letters are his most distinctive contribution beyond painting - over 900 letters documenting his thinking process. The methodology is highly actionable (write as if to a supportive recipient, include sketches/diagrams, mix practical and profound). Reusable for any creative professional. Medium priority because the format is somewhat niche.

## Overlap Analysis

| Candidate | Potentially Similar Existing Skill | Overlap % | Decision |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|-----------|----------|
| expressive-color-translation | color-emotion-translation | 60% | CREATE - Van Gogh's specific methodology (complementary contrasts, exaggeration for truth) is distinct |
| persistence-through-struggle | keep-going-protocol | 40% | CREATE - Van Gogh's framing (work as salvation, silencing the critic through action) is unique |
| overlooked-beauty-discovery | None identified | 0% | CREATE |
| epistolary-creative-reflection | None identified | 0% | CREATE |

Note: `color-emotion-translation` exists but focuses on general color-emotion mapping. The van Gogh skill adds his specific theory of complementary contrasts and "exaggeration for truth" methodology.
