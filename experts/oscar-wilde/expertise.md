## Key Works

### The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890-1891)
Wilde's only novel. A young man wishes that his portrait would age instead of him, allowing him to pursue pleasure without consequence. The portrait becomes a moral mirror, revealing the corruption of his soul.

**Core themes:**
- Aestheticism and its dangers when pursued without ethics
- The relationship between art, beauty, and morality
- The corruption that comes from living only for pleasure
- The mask vs. the true self
- The impossibility of escaping consequence

### The Importance of Being Earnest (1895)
A "trivial comedy for serious people." Two men create fictional personas (Bunburying) to escape social obligations, leading to farcical complications. Wilde's masterpiece of wit and paradox.

**Core themes:**
- The absurdity of Victorian social conventions
- The performative nature of identity
- Style over substance as philosophy
- Marriage, class, and the triviality of what society deems important
- Truth through absurdity

### De Profundis (1897, published 1905)
A letter written from Reading Gaol to Lord Alfred Douglas. A meditation on suffering, forgiveness, and spiritual transformation. The dark counterpoint to Wilde's earlier celebration of pleasure.

**Core themes:**
- Suffering as teacher and transformer
- The discovery of humility through disgrace
- Christ as the supreme artist of life
- Sorrow as the path to truth
- The integration of beauty with suffering

### Other Important Works
- **Lady Windermere's Fan** (1892) - Comedy of manners about secrets and morality
- **A Woman of No Importance** (1893) - Social drama with characteristic wit
- **An Ideal Husband** (1895) - Political corruption and moral flexibility
- **Salome** (1891) - Symbolist tragedy, originally in French
- **The Soul of Man Under Socialism** (1891) - Essay on individualism and art
- **Essays and Lectures** - "The Decay of Lying," "The Critic as Artist"

## Historical Context

### The Aesthetic Movement
- Reaction against Victorian utilitarianism and moral didacticism
- "Art for art's sake" (l'art pour l'art)
- Walter Pater's influence: "To burn always with this hard, gem-like flame"
- James McNeill Whistler's art-as-pure-aesthetic philosophy
- Wilde became the public face of Aestheticism

### Victorian Society
- Rigid moral codes and sexual repression
- Class stratification and social performance
- The double life as survival mechanism
- Growing tension between public morality and private behavior
- Wilde's trial exposed Victorian hypocrisy

### Key Figures in Wilde's Life
- **Walter Pater** - Oxford don, aesthetic philosopher, profound influence
- **James McNeill Whistler** - Painter, early friend then rival
- **Lord Alfred Douglas (Bosie)** - Lover, catalyst for his downfall
- **Constance Lloyd** - Wife, mother of his children
- **Marquess of Queensberry** - Douglas's father, whose accusation led to Wilde's trials

## Core Concepts

### Aestheticism
Art exists for beauty alone, not for moral instruction. Beauty is the highest value. Life should be lived as art.

**Wilde's formulation:** "All art is quite useless" - meaning art's purpose is not utility but beauty. This is praise, not condemnation.

### The Paradox as Truth-Telling
Inverting conventional wisdom to reveal hidden truth. The paradox startles the listener out of comfortable assumptions.

**Examples:**
- "I can resist everything except temptation."
- "The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it."
- "To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all."

### Style as Substance
Manner matters more than matter. How you say something reveals more than what you say. Surface is depth.

**Wilde's formulation:** "In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing."

### The Mask and Authenticity
We reveal ourselves most truly through our masks. The posed self is more authentic than the "natural" self, which is merely conformity to convention.

**Wilde's formulation:** "Man is least himself when he talks in his own person. Give him a mask, and he will tell you the truth."

### The Critic as Artist
Criticism is itself a creative act, not subordinate to the work it discusses. The critic brings as much to art as the artist.

**Wilde's formulation:** "Criticism is itself an art... the critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things."

### Individualism as Ethics
True morality is self-realization, not conformity to social rules. The highest duty is to develop one's own personality fully.

**Wilde's formulation:** "Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live."

## Famous Epigrams and Aphorisms

### On Art and Aesthetics
- "All art is quite useless."
- "No great artist ever sees things as they really are. If he did, he would cease to be an artist."
- "Life imitates Art far more than Art imitates Life."
- "The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely."

### On Society and Morality
- "Morality is simply the attitude we adopt towards people we personally dislike."
- "Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing."
- "Society often forgives the criminal; it never forgives the dreamer."
- "The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about."

### On Truth and Deception
- "The truth is rarely pure and never simple."
- "If you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you."
- "I am so clever that sometimes I don't understand a single word of what I am saying."
- "The pure and simple truth is rarely pure and never simple."

### On Love and Relations
- "To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance."
- "Women are meant to be loved, not to be understood."
- "Between men and women there is no friendship possible. There is passion, enmity, worship, love, but no friendship."
- "A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he does not love her."

### On Experience and Youth
- "Experience is simply the name we give our mistakes."
- "The old believe everything; the middle-aged suspect everything; the young know everything."
- "I am not young enough to know everything."

### On Work and Pleasure
- "Work is the curse of the drinking classes."
- "I have the simplest tastes. I am always satisfied with the best."
- "I can resist everything except temptation."
- "Moderation is a fatal thing. Nothing succeeds like excess."

## The Paradox of Oscar Wilde

Wilde's life embodied his philosophy:
- The wit who wrote from prison about suffering
- The aesthete who found meaning in disgrace
- The pleasure-seeker who discovered spiritual depth
- The performer whose mask became his truth
- The man who declared "I put all my genius into my life; I put only my talent into my works"

His tragedy completed his meaning. De Profundis would not exist without his fall. The integration of joy and sorrow, beauty and pain, became his ultimate artistic achievement.
