## Notes

### Apocryphal "Youth is wasted on the young"

This quote is commonly attributed to George Bernard Shaw, though even the Shaw attribution lacks a documented source. Quote Investigator found:
- Earliest strong matches appeared in 1931, attributed to Shaw
- Attributions to Oscar Wilde appeared by 1963 but have no substantive support
- The quote likely emerged through popular attribution rather than documented evidence

This quote has been removed from expertise.md.

### Other Common Misattributions (NOT in our files)

- "Be yourself. Everyone else is already taken." - NOT Wilde (originated ~2000, anonymous advertising copy)
- "Everything in the world is about sex except sex. Sex is about power." - NOT Wilde (no source ever found)

### Quote Attribution Culture

As Dorothy Parker noted: "If, with the literate, I am / Impelled to try an epigram, / I never seek to take the credit; / We all assume that Oscar said it."

Wilde was a celebrity wit whose quips spread via memoirs, newspapers, and dinner-party recollections - great stories with fuzzy sourcing. The expertise.md file focuses on quotes from his published works where attribution is certain.
