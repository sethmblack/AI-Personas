## HIGH Priority

### 1. paradox-craft

**Source Pattern:** The Technique of Inversion / The Paradoxical Inversion
**Purpose:** Transform conventional statements into paradoxical insights that reveal hidden truths.
**Trigger:** "Turn this into a Wilde paradox" or "What's the paradox here?" or "Flip this cliche"
**Inputs:** Conventional statement, cliche, or assumption to be inverted
**Outputs:** Paradoxical inversion with explanation of what truth the original concealed
**Reasoning:** This is Wilde's signature technique--a replicable process for generating insight through inversion. 4-step workflow: identify convention, invert it, extract hidden truth, craft memorable phrasing. Widely applicable to writing, marketing, creative work, and critical thinking.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Justification |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear 4-step process: identify, invert, extract, craft |
| Invocable | 10 | Natural trigger phrases ("flip this," "paradox," "invert") |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: turn convention into paradox |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to writing, marketing, speechmaking, critical thinking |
| Valuable | 9 | Creates memorable, quotable insights from ordinary observations |
| **TOTAL** | **46** | **HIGH PRIORITY** |

### 2. epigram-forge

**Source Pattern:** The Aphoristic Compression / Famous Epigrams
**Purpose:** Compress complex observations into single memorable sentences with the structure and elegance of Wilde's epigrams.
**Trigger:** "Make this quotable" or "Forge an epigram" or "Give me a one-liner"
**Inputs:** Observation, insight, or idea to be compressed
**Outputs:** Polished epigram with analysis of its construction (rhythm, surprise, balance)
**Reasoning:** Wilde's epigrams remain in use 125 years later because they follow patterns that can be taught: balanced antithesis, surprising turns, the final twist. This skill teaches the craft of memorable phrasing for taglines, headlines, quotable content, and personal brand.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Justification |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Actionable | 8 | Structural patterns: antithesis, turn, twist |
| Invocable | 10 | Clear triggers ("make this quotable," "one-liner") |
| Scoped | 9 | Single task: compress to memorable sentence |
| Reusable | 10 | Headlines, taglines, speeches, social media, branding |
| Valuable | 9 | Quotable content is high-value in attention economy |
| **TOTAL** | **46** | **HIGH PRIORITY** |

### 3. aesthetic-critique

**Source Pattern:** The Critic as Artist / Aesthetic Consciousness
**Purpose:** Analyze any work, situation, or proposition through the lens of aesthetics rather than utility, revealing dimensions that practical analysis misses.
**Trigger:** "Give me an aesthetic critique" or "What's beautiful about this?" or "Analyze this as art"
**Inputs:** Work, product, situation, or communication to be critiqued
**Outputs:** Aesthetic analysis covering: beauty present, beauty missing, style vs. substance, surface as depth, what the aesthetic dimension reveals
**Reasoning:** Wilde's principle that criticism is itself an art, and that aesthetic analysis reveals truths that utilitarian analysis cannot. Useful for design review, creative feedback, brand assessment, and finding the overlooked dimension in any situation.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Justification |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Actionable | 7 | Framework clear but requires aesthetic judgment |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural trigger ("aesthetic critique," "analyze as art") |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused on aesthetic dimension, but broad application |
| Reusable | 9 | Design, creative work, branding, communication, lifestyle |
| Valuable | 8 | Reveals overlooked dimension, adds differentiation |
| **TOTAL** | **41** | **HIGH PRIORITY** |

### 4. wit-as-weapon

**Source Pattern:** The Art of Conversation / Making serious points through levity
**Purpose:** Address difficult situations, criticism, or conflict through wit rather than earnestness, disarming opponents and maintaining grace under pressure.
**Trigger:** "Help me respond with wit" or "How would Wilde handle this criticism?" or "Give me a witty comeback"
**Inputs:** Criticism, conflict, or difficult situation requiring response; tone desired (light deflection vs. pointed riposte)
**Outputs:** Witty response with explanation of its construction and why wit serves better than earnest defense
**Reasoning:** Wilde's principle that "if you want to tell people the truth, make them laugh, otherwise they'll kill you." A framework for responding to criticism, conflict, and social difficulty with grace rather than defensiveness. Highly valuable for public figures, brand management, and anyone facing public scrutiny.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Justification |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Actionable | 8 | Principles clear: deflect, elevate, never explain |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers ("witty response," "how would Wilde respond") |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused on witty response to difficulty |
| Reusable | 9 | PR, social media, interpersonal conflict, criticism response |
| Valuable | 9 | High demand for graceful response to criticism |
| **TOTAL** | **43** | **HIGH PRIORITY** |

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. surface-as-depth

**Source Pattern:** Style as Substance / The Mask and Authenticity
**Purpose:** Analyze how surface presentation (style, manner, appearance) reveals rather than conceals deeper truths, contrary to the assumption that depth lies beneath surface.
**Trigger:** "What does the surface reveal?" or "Analyze style as substance"
**Inputs:** Presentation, persona, brand, or communication style to analyze
**Outputs:** Analysis of what the surface reveals about underlying values, the choices embedded in presentation, and what "authenticity through artifice" means in this context
**Reasoning:** Wilde's counterintuitive insight that masks reveal more than faces, that style is substance. Useful for brand analysis, personal branding, interview preparation, and understanding how presentation choices communicate.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Justification |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Actionable | 6 | Conceptual framework more than step-by-step process |
| Invocable | 7 | Trigger phrases exist but less natural |
| Scoped | 7 | Focused concept but overlaps with aesthetic critique |
| Reusable | 8 | Branding, interviewing, design, self-presentation |
| Valuable | 7 | Useful insight but less immediately practical |
| **TOTAL** | **35** | **MEDIUM PRIORITY** |

### 6. individualism-ethics

**Source Pattern:** Individualism as Ethics / The Soul of Man Under Socialism
**Purpose:** Reframe ethical questions through the lens of self-realization rather than rule-following, asking what authentic self-development requires rather than what convention demands.
**Trigger:** "What would authentic self-realization require?" or "Is this rule-following or genuine ethics?"
**Inputs:** Ethical dilemma or decision involving tension between convention and individual expression
**Outputs:** Analysis distinguishing conformity from genuine ethics, with guidance toward self-realization that is neither selfish nor merely conventional
**Reasoning:** Wilde's ethical philosophy: "Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live." A framework for ethical decisions that honors individuality without abandoning responsibility.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Justification |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Actionable | 5 | Philosophical framework, less procedural |
| Invocable | 6 | Triggers less natural in everyday use |
| Scoped | 7 | Focused on ethics of self-realization |
| Reusable | 7 | Career decisions, life choices, creative integrity |
| Valuable | 7 | Meaningful framework but niche application |
| **TOTAL** | **32** | **MEDIUM PRIORITY** |
