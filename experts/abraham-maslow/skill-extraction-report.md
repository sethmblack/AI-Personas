- **Invocable** - Could be triggered by request
- **Scoped** - One responsibility, clear boundaries
- **Reusable** - Applies across contexts
- **Valuable** - Saves significant effort

---

## HIGH Priority Candidates (Recommend Implementation)

### 1. needs-assessment

**Description:** Apply Maslow's hierarchy of needs to diagnose which level is most pressing for an individual, team, or organization.

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Actionable | 5-level framework with clear indicators for each level; diagnostic questions available |
| Invocable | "What does this person/team need?" / "Assess the hierarchy" / "Why is this team struggling?" |
| Scoped | Single responsibility: identify the most pressing need level |
| Reusable | Applies to individuals, teams, organizations, career situations, relationships |
| Valuable | Foundational diagnostic that changes the entire approach to helping |

**Inputs:** Situation description, symptoms/behaviors observed
**Outputs:** Need level identification, specific recommendations for that level

### 2. motivation-diagnosis

**Description:** Distinguish between D-motivation (deficiency-based, fear-driven) and B-motivation (growth-based, being-driven) to understand the quality and sustainability of motivation.

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Actionable | Clear D vs. B framework with distinct characteristics; applies to all motivation |
| Invocable | "Is this driven by fear or growth?" / "Analyze the motivation" / "Why am I doing this?" |
| Scoped | Single responsibility: diagnose motivation type and quality |
| Reusable | Applies to career decisions, creative work, relationships, management |
| Valuable | Fundamentally changes approach; D-motivation requires different response than B-motivation |

**Inputs:** Goal, behavior, or stated motivation
**Outputs:** D or B classification, implications, guidance for shifting if needed

### 3. jonah-complex-diagnosis

**Description:** Identify and address the Jonah Complex—the fear of one's own greatness and potential that leads to self-sabotage.

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Actionable | Clear manifestations, root causes, and specific advice from Maslow for overcoming |
| Invocable | "Am I afraid of success?" / "Why am I self-sabotaging?" / "I keep backing away when things get good" |
| Scoped | Single responsibility: identify fear of greatness and path forward |
| Reusable | Applies to career, creative work, personal development, leadership |
| Valuable | Addresses a common but hidden barrier; often misdiagnosed as laziness or lack of ability |

**Inputs:** Pattern of behavior (self-sabotage, backing away from success, false modesty)
**Outputs:** Jonah Complex assessment, specific root causes, Maslow's advice for overcoming

---

### 4. growth-choice-analysis

**Description:** Analyze decisions through the lens of growth vs. safety to support self-actualization through daily choices.

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Actionable | Defensive-wisdom vs. growth-wisdom framework; clear indicators |
| Invocable | "Is this a growth choice or a fear choice?" / "Help me decide" / "Am I playing it safe?" |
| Scoped | Single responsibility: classify decision orientation and implications |
| Reusable | Applies to any decision—career, relationship, creative, daily life |
| Valuable | Practical, daily application; self-actualization happens through accumulated small choices |

**Inputs:** Decision or choice under consideration
**Outputs:** Growth/safety classification, what each path implies, guidance for growth choice

---

## MEDIUM Priority Candidates (Consider for Future)

### 5. peak-experience-cultivation

**Description:** Recognize peak experiences and understand conditions that cultivate them.

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Actionable | 16 aspects defined; triggers listed; characteristics clear |
| Invocable | "Was that a peak experience?" / "How do I have more peak experiences?" |
| Scoped | Somewhat broad—both recognition and cultivation |
| Reusable | Applies to personal development, creativity, spirituality |
| Valuable | Meaningful but more abstract/subjective than other skills |

**Recommendation:** Could be developed but may be better as reference material than invocable skill.

---

## Skills NOT Recommended

### Self-Actualization Assessment
- Too broad and subjective
- Maslow himself found only 2% self-actualized
- Better as an aspirational framework than diagnostic

### B-Values Identification
- Overlaps heavily with motivation-diagnosis
- 16 values are better as reference material
- Not enough actionable steps for a standalone skill

### Eupsychian Management Analysis
- Too specialized for organizational contexts only
- Better integrated into general expert guidance
- Less personally applicable

---

## Summary

| Priority | Skill | Recommendation |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| HIGH | needs-assessment | Implement |
| HIGH | motivation-diagnosis | Implement |
| HIGH | jonah-complex-diagnosis | Implement |
| HIGH | growth-choice-analysis | Implement |
| MEDIUM | peak-experience-cultivation | Reference only |

**Total Skills to Implement:** 4

## Integration Notes

These four skills form a coherent system:
1. **needs-assessment** - Where are you in the hierarchy?
2. **motivation-diagnosis** - What quality is your motivation?
3. **jonah-complex-diagnosis** - Are you blocking yourself from greatness?
4. **growth-choice-analysis** - How do you make decisions that move you forward?

All four complement each other and represent Maslow's most practical, actionable insights.
