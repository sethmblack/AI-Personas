## Notes

### Attribution Notes
- The "hammer and nail" quote is legitimately Maslow's (1966) but the underlying concept was first articulated by Abraham Kaplan (1962-1964). The expertise.md and PROMPT.md include this nuance.

### Scholarly Caution
- Maslow's methodology (biographical analysis of self-actualized individuals) has been critiqued for subjectivity and sampling bias. This is documented in the expertise.md under "Scientific Criticisms and Limitations."

### Cultural Sensitivity
- The Blackfoot (Siksika) connection is documented with appropriate scholarly nuance, noting that while some Indigenous academics see influence, the foremost Blackfoot researchers on the topic (Ryan Heavy Head and Narcisse Blood) do not claim appropriation.
