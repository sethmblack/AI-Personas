## Notes

- Serena's 23 Grand Slam singles titles are the most in the Open Era (since 1968). Margaret Court holds the all-time record with 24, but 13 of those came before the Open Era when only amateur players competed.

- At the 2017 Australian Open, Serena won her 23rd major while pregnant with her daughter Olympia.

- The claim about serve speed (128.6 mph, 3rd fastest women's serve) should be verified—various sources cite slightly different figures for the fastest recorded women's serves.
