## HIGH Priority

### 1. empathic-listening

**Source Pattern:** Active Listening / Reflective Listening + Empathy
**Purpose:** Deeply understand another person's experience by listening for feelings beneath words and reflecting understanding without judgment or advice.
**Trigger:** "Help me understand what they're feeling" or "How do I really listen?" or "Practice empathic listening with me"
**Inputs:** What the person has said or shared, context of the situation
**Outputs:** Reflective response demonstrating understanding, identification of core feelings, suggested follow-up questions that deepen exploration
**Reasoning:** This is Rogers's foundational methodology—the practical application of empathy. Clear technique with specific methods (simple reflection, feeling reflection, amplified reflection, double-sided reflection, summary). Widely applicable across therapy, coaching, management, relationships, and difficult conversations. Time-saving by providing structured approach to a skill most people struggle with.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific reflection techniques with examples
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases exist
- Scoped: YES - one responsibility (understanding and reflecting)

### 2. psychological-safety-creation

**Source Pattern:** The Six Necessary and Sufficient Conditions + Unconditional Positive Regard
**Purpose:** Create conditions where another person feels safe enough to be honest, vulnerable, and explore difficult material without fear of judgment.
**Trigger:** "How do I make this a safe space?" or "Create psychological safety" or "Help them feel safe opening up"
**Inputs:** Context of the relationship or environment, specific concerns about safety
**Outputs:** Assessment of current safety barriers, specific behaviors to adopt (and avoid), language patterns that communicate acceptance, environmental considerations
**Reasoning:** Rogers's core insight was that growth happens in certain relational conditions. This skill operationalizes those conditions for practical application. Highly relevant to leadership, parenting, teaching, healthcare, and any helping relationship. Addresses a widely recognized need (psychological safety is now mainstream in organizational psychology).

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific conditions and behaviors
- Invocable: YES - "psychological safety" is now common language
- Scoped: YES - creating conditions for openness
- Reusable: YES - teams, families, classrooms, therapy, coaching
- Valuable: YES - foundational for trust and growth

**Score: 44/50**

### 3. congruence-check

**Source Pattern:** Congruence (Genuineness) + Real Self vs. Ideal Self
**Purpose:** Assess the alignment between inner experience and outer expression, identifying where incongruence may be causing difficulty.
**Trigger:** "Am I being authentic here?" or "Check my congruence" or "Why do I feel fake in this situation?"
**Inputs:** Description of a situation where the person feels stuck, uncomfortable, or inauthentic
**Outputs:** Identification of possible gaps between inner and outer, exploration of conditions of worth that may be driving incongruence, suggestions for moving toward greater congruence
**Reasoning:** Congruence is one of Rogers's three core conditions and central to his theory of distress. Provides a clear diagnostic for personal authenticity struggles. Applicable to career decisions, relationships, leadership, and personal development. Helps people understand why they feel "off" in certain contexts.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear assessment process
- Invocable: YES - authenticity questions are common
- Scoped: YES - assessing alignment between inner and outer
- Reusable: YES - any situation involving authenticity

### 4. growth-facilitation

**Source Pattern:** The Actualizing Tendency + Trust in the Organism
**Purpose:** Help someone move toward growth by trusting their innate direction rather than imposing external solutions or advice.
**Trigger:** "How do I help without taking over?" or "Facilitate their growth" or "They need to figure this out themselves"
**Inputs:** Description of someone you want to help, your relationship to them, what you've already tried
**Outputs:** Reframe from "fixing" to "facilitating," specific facilitative behaviors, questions that invite self-discovery, guidance on when to step back
**Reasoning:** Rogers's fundamental stance—trust the person's own actualizing tendency rather than imposing direction. Counter-intuitive for most helpers who want to fix. Provides clear alternative to advice-giving. Applicable to parenting, management, coaching, mentoring, friendship.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear stance and behaviors
- Invocable: YES - common helping dilemmas trigger this
- Scoped: YES - facilitating vs. directing
- Reusable: YES - any helping relationship
- Valuable: YES - prevents counterproductive over-helping

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. acceptance-practice

**Source Pattern:** Unconditional Positive Regard + The Curious Paradox
**Purpose:** Practice accepting yourself or another person fully, without conditions, as the foundation for change.
**Trigger:** "I can't accept this about myself" or "Practice acceptance" or "How do I stop judging?"
**Inputs:** What the person is struggling to accept (about self or other)
**Outputs:** Reframe of the paradox (acceptance enables change), exploration of conditions of worth, specific acceptance practices, distinction between accepting and approving
**Reasoning:** The "curious paradox"—acceptance precedes change—is one of Rogers's most counterintuitive and valuable insights. Clear process for applying this in practice. Relevant to self-improvement, relationships, and therapy. Addresses the common trap of trying to force change through self-criticism.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific paradox and practices
- Invocable: YES - acceptance struggles are common
- Scoped: YES - practicing unconditional acceptance
- Reusable: YES - self-acceptance, accepting others
- Valuable: YES - addresses counterproductive pattern

**Score: 38/50**

### 6. locus-of-evaluation-shift

**Source Pattern:** The Locus of Evaluation + People Are Their Own Best Experts
**Purpose:** Help someone shift from external evaluation (what others think) to internal evaluation (their own felt sense of what is right).
**Trigger:** "I don't know what I want" or "I care too much what others think" or "Help me trust myself"
**Inputs:** Description of decision or situation where person feels dependent on external validation
**Outputs:** Identification of external evaluation patterns, exploration of inner knowing, specific practices for developing internal locus, distinction between considering input and depending on it
**Reasoning:** Rogers believed psychological freedom comes when the locus of evaluation moves inside. Common issue—many people are disconnected from their own sense of what's right for them. Clear therapeutic goal with practical applications. Relevant to identity, decision-making, and self-trust.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - identifiable shift with practices
- Invocable: YES - self-trust questions trigger this
- Scoped: YES - external to internal evaluation
- Reusable: YES - decisions, identity, relationships
- Valuable: YES - addresses common dependency pattern

**Score: 36/50**

### 7. non-directive-questioning

**Source Pattern:** Following the Person's Lead + Non-Directive Stance
**Purpose:** Ask questions that open exploration without imposing direction, allowing the other person to lead where they need to go.
**Trigger:** "What questions should I ask?" or "How do I explore without leading?" or "Non-directive questions"
**Inputs:** Topic or situation to explore, what has already been discussed
**Outputs:** Series of open, exploratory questions that follow the person's direction; guidance on what NOT to ask (leading questions, advice disguised as questions)
**Reasoning:** Many people want to help through good questions but inadvertently lead or advise. Rogers's non-directive approach provides a clear alternative. Applicable to coaching, therapy, management, parenting, journalism. Saves time by providing templates for exploration.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific question patterns
- Invocable: YES - "what questions should I ask" is natural
- Scoped: YES - non-directive questioning
- Reusable: YES - any exploratory conversation
- Valuable: YES - improves conversations measurably
