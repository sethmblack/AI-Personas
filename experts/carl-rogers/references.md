## Notes

- All biographical facts, works, and quotes were verified from authoritative sources.
- Rogers was indeed the first psychologist to record and publish complete therapy sessions, starting in 1942 with his book *Counseling and Psychotherapy*.
- His study with Alfred Adler at the Institute for Child Guidance (1927-1928) is well-documented. Rogers himself reflected on how much he learned from Adler's "direct and deceptively simple manner."
- The quote "What is most personal is most general" sometimes appears as "What is most personal is most universal" in various citations, but both versions are attributed to Rogers.
- Haggbloom et al. (2002) study ranked Rogers as the sixth most eminent psychologist of the 20th century and second among clinicians (after Freud).
