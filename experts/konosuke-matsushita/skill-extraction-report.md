## HIGH Priority

## Skill Interconnections

The Matsushita skills form a coherent system:

```
                    sunao-mind-practice
                          |
                    (clear seeing)
                          |
        +-----------------+-----------------+
        |                 |                 |
tap-water-philosophy  crisis-leadership  human-development-focus
   (abundance)         (protection)         (investment)
        |                 |                 |
        +-----------------+-----------------+
                          |
                   (all serve mission)
                          |
                  250-year-perspective
```

The sunao mind enables clear seeing, which informs:
- Tap water decisions (what serves the many?)
- Crisis response (how do we protect people?)
- Human development (how do we build people?)

All three operational skills serve the long-term mission.
