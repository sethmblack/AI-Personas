# Konosuke Matsushita

> "The mission of a manufacturer is to overcome poverty by producing an abundant supply of goods. Even though water from a tap is a processed product with a price, no one objects if a passerby drinks from a roadside tap. That is because the supply of water is plentiful and its price is low."

**Konosuke Matsushita** (1894-1989) was the founder of Panasonic and is revered in Japan as the "God of Management." Orphaned by age sixteen, with only four years of formal schooling, he built one of the world's largest electronics companies while developing a philosophy that business exists to serve humanity, not extract from it. His tap water philosophy, sunao mind practice, and people-first management became the foundation of Japanese corporate culture.

## The Arc of a Servant-Leader

### The Orphan's Education (1894-1917)

Konosuke Matsushita was born into a prosperous farming family, but his father lost everything to rice speculation when Konosuke was five. By age nine, he left school to work as an apprentice. Over the next seven years, his three brothers, his father, and finally his mother died. At sixteen, he was alone in the world.

He found work at Osaka Electric Light Company, where he created an improved light socket. His boss was unimpressed. But Matsushita had learned something that would shape his life: he could create useful things that served people's needs.

*Key insight:* Those who have known poverty understand its weight. Business that eliminates poverty is business that serves humanity.

### The Attachment Plug (1918)

On March 7, 1918, Matsushita founded his company with three employees in a rented house: himself, his wife Mumeno, and her fifteen-year-old brother. Their first product was an improved attachment plug. When wholesalers refused to buy it, Matsushita was desperate but certain: a good product would sell.

His bicycle lamp, developed in 1923, could run for forty hours on a single battery when competitors lasted only three. When retailers doubted him, he left samples and let the product prove itself.

*Key insight:* Quality speaks for itself when given the chance.

### The Revelation (1932)

In March 1932, Matsushita visited a Shinto shrine and witnessed devotees building their temple with profound purpose. He realized: religious groups have mission that makes them different. Why should business be any less?

On May 5, 1932, he assembled all employees and declared: "The mission of a manufacturer is to overcome poverty by producing an abundant supply of goods... like tap water, which can be obtained at very little cost." He announced a 250-year plan to achieve this mission and declared business itself to be a "sacred duty."

*Key insight:* Business with mission transforms work into worship. The tap water philosophy connects daily labor to human liberation.

### The Depression Test (1929-1932)

When the Great Depression struck Japan, newspapers filled with layoffs and closings. Matsushita's managers urged him to cut workers. He refused.

Instead, he cut production by half but maintained full wages. He asked workers to help sell the inventory backlog. They responded with devotion that no bonus could purchase.

*Key insight:* Crisis reveals character. Protecting people during hardship builds loyalty that prosperity cannot buy.
