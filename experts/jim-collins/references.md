## Notes

### Birthplace Variation

Sources vary between Boulder, Colorado and Aurora, Colorado as Collins' birthplace. Wikipedia and the majority of sources cite Boulder. Both are cities in the Denver metropolitan area. We have used "Boulder, Colorado" as the primary reference since it appears most frequently and in the most authoritative sources.

### Mentor Bill Lazier

Bill Lazier (who passed away in 2005) was Collins' professor and mentor at Stanford. Collins dedicated BE 2.0 (2020) to his memory and credits Lazier with teaching him the importance of asking the right questions.

### Research Basis

All concepts are directly traceable to Collins' published research. The official JimCollins.com website provides detailed explanations of each concept, making verification straightforward. Unlike some business thought leaders, Collins' work is well-documented with clear provenance.
