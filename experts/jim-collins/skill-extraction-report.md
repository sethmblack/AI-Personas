## HIGH Priority

### 1. hedgehog-concept-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** The Hedgehog Concept framework (three circles)
**Purpose:** Guide organizations to identify the intersection of what they can be best at, what drives their economic engine, and what they are deeply passionate about
**Trigger:** "What should we focus on?", "What's our core strategy?", "We're doing too many things", strategic clarity needed
**Inputs:** Organization description, current activities, market position, team capabilities, financial metrics
**Outputs:** Three-circles assessment, Hedgehog Concept statement (or diagnosis of missing elements), recommended strategic focus
**Reasoning:** Clear 3-step framework (best at, economic engine, passion intersection), used frequently for strategic planning, saves significant time vs. unfocused brainstorming, directly actionable with specific questions for each circle. High reusability across any organization type.

### 2. level-5-leadership-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Level 5 Hierarchy (5 levels of leadership)
**Purpose:** Assess leadership against Collins' research-based hierarchy, identifying current level and path to Level 5
**Trigger:** "Am I a Level 5 leader?", "How can I improve my leadership?", leadership evaluation, executive development
**Inputs:** Leadership behaviors (self-reported or observed), attribution patterns (window vs. mirror), ambition orientation
**Outputs:** Current level assessment (1-5), specific gaps, development recommendations, window/mirror analysis
**Reasoning:** Structured 5-level hierarchy with clear criteria at each level, window/mirror framework provides concrete diagnostic, high demand for leadership assessment tools, directly from Collins' most cited research.

### 3. flywheel-mapping

**Source Pattern:** Flywheel and Doom Loop concepts
**Purpose:** Map an organization's flywheel (momentum-building cycle) or diagnose doom loop patterns
**Trigger:** "How do we build momentum?", "What drives our success?", "We keep lurching from initiative to initiative", breakthrough strategy
**Inputs:** Key organizational activities, historical initiatives, resource allocation patterns, results correlation
**Outputs:** Visual flywheel map (sequential momentum components), doom loop diagnosis (if present), recommended push points
**Reasoning:** Distinctive Collins framework with clear visual output, differentiates breakthrough companies from comparison cases, actionable for strategic alignment, high reuse across organizations seeking sustainable momentum.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. bhag-creation

**Source Pattern:** BHAG (Big Hairy Audacious Goal) framework from Built to Last
**Purpose:** Create compelling 10-25 year goals that inspire and focus organizational energy
**Trigger:** "What's our big goal?", "What should we aim for?", "We need a compelling vision", long-term goal setting
**Inputs:** Core values, current capabilities, industry context, aspiration level, time horizon preference
**Outputs:** Draft BHAG statement, type classification (target, competitive, role model, or transformation), probability assessment (50-70% target)
**Reasoning:** Well-defined framework with four BHAG types, specific success criteria (10-25 years, 50-70% probability), frequently requested for strategic planning. Medium priority because less frequently needed than tactical frameworks.

### 5. stockdale-paradox-application

**Source Pattern:** Stockdale Paradox (unwavering faith + brutal facts)
**Purpose:** Guide leaders through balancing realism and optimism when facing significant challenges
**Trigger:** "How do we stay motivated in hard times?", "We're facing serious challenges", crisis navigation, team morale in adversity
**Inputs:** Current reality (brutal facts), desired outcome, team morale state, timeline constraints
**Outputs:** Brutal facts inventory, faith articulation, balance assessment, recommended communication approach
**Reasoning:** Powerful framework for adversity, clearly actionable (confront facts + maintain faith), distinguishes from naive optimism. Medium priority due to situational trigger (adversity-specific).

### 6. first-who-assessment

**Source Pattern:** First Who, Then What (right people on the bus)
**Purpose:** Evaluate team composition against Collins' criteria for organizational greatness
**Trigger:** "Do we have the right team?", "Who should be on the bus?", hiring decisions, team restructuring
**Inputs:** Current team roster, role responsibilities, observed behaviors, self-motivation evidence, adaptability history
**Outputs:** Bus audit (right seat, wrong seat, wrong bus), specific people recommendations, hiring criteria
**Reasoning:** Core Collins principle with clear diagnostic criteria (self-motivated, right seat, adaptable), applicable to any team size. Medium priority because overlaps with standard HR assessment tools.

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Five Stages of Decline | Diagnostic awareness, not actionable workflow; organizations rarely self-diagnose decline stages |
| 20 Mile March | Discipline principle rather than actionable framework; implementation varies too much by context |
| Fire Bullets Then Cannonballs | Investment philosophy; implementation depends heavily on resource context |
| Clock Building vs. Time Telling | Conceptual distinction rather than repeatable workflow |
| Return on Luck | Retrospective analysis concept; cannot be prospectively applied |
| SMaC Recipe | Too organization-specific to generalize as skill |
| Preserve Core/Stimulate Progress | Conceptual framework without clear step-by-step process |
| Culture of Discipline | Principle to be internalized, not skill to be invoked |
