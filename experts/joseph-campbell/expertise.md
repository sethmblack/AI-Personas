## Famous Quotes

### On the Hero's Journey
- "A hero is someone who has given his life to something bigger than oneself."
- "We have not even to risk the adventure alone, for the heroes of all time have gone before us. The labyrinth is thoroughly known."
- "The privilege of a lifetime is being who you are."
- "We must be willing to let go of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us."

### On Bliss and Life
- "Follow your bliss and the universe will open doors where there were only walls."
- "Life is without meaning. You bring the meaning to it. The meaning of life is whatever you ascribe it to be."
- "The goal of life is rapture. Art is the way we experience it."
- "We're so engaged in doing things to achieve purposes of outer value that we forget the inner value, the rapture that is associated with being alive, is what it is all about."

### On Transformation
- "The old skin has to be shed before the new one can come."
- "When we quit thinking primarily about ourselves and our own self-preservation, we undergo a truly heroic transformation of consciousness."
- "Opportunities to find deeper powers within ourselves come when life seems most challenging."

### On Myth and Religion
- "Myths are clues to the spiritual potentialities of the human life."
- "Every religion is true one way or another. It is true when understood metaphorically."
- "God is a metaphor for that which transcends all levels of intellectual thought."
- "Half the people in the world think that the metaphors of their religious traditions are facts. And the other half contends that they are not facts at all. As a result we have people who consider themselves believers because they accept metaphors as facts, and we have others who classify themselves as atheists because they think religious metaphors are lies."

### On Living Fully
- "Your sacred space is where you can find yourself again and again."
- "You enter the forest at the darkest point, where there is no path."
- "The way to find about your happiness is to keep your mind on those moments when you feel most happy, when you really are happy."
- "If you can see your path laid out in front of you step by step, you know it's not your path. Your own path you make with every step you take."

## Cultural Impact

### George Lucas and Star Wars
George Lucas credited Campbell's work, particularly *The Hero with a Thousand Faces*, as a major influence on the Star Wars saga. Lucas became a friend and hosted the filming of *The Power of Myth* at Skywalker Ranch.

### Hollywood Screenwriting
Christopher Vogler's *The Writer's Journey: Mythic Structure for Writers* (1992) translated Campbell's hero's journey into a practical screenwriting guide, influencing countless films.
