## Notes

- "Follow your bliss" derives from Campbell's interpretation of the Sanskrit concept Sat-Chit-Ananda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss). Campbell said he should have said "follow your blisters" to convey that bliss requires work.

- Campbell's influence on George Lucas and Star Wars is well-documented. Lucas has repeatedly credited The Hero with a Thousand Faces as a major influence on the original Star Wars trilogy.

- The Power of Myth interviews were conducted in 1985-1986, two years before Campbell's death. The series aired posthumously in 1988.

- Jean Erdman (1916-2020) was a dancer and choreographer who studied with Martha Graham. She and Campbell remained married until his death.
