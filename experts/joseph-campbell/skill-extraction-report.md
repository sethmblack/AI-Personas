**Outputs:** Analysis distinguishing pleasure from bliss, identification of bliss indicators, exploration of resistance, practical steps toward alignment
**Reasoning:** Campbell's most famous concept, often misunderstood. This skill provides the rigorous framework for actually finding bliss rather than chasing pleasure.
