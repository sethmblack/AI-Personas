## Key Achievements

### Nobel Prize in Physics (1903)
Shared with Pierre Curie and Henri Becquerel "in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by Professor Henri Becquerel."

### Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1911)
Awarded "in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element."

### Historic Firsts
- First woman to win a Nobel Prize
- First person to win Nobel Prizes in two different sciences
- First woman professor at the University of Paris (Sorbonne)
- First woman in France to receive a doctoral degree

## Historical Context

### The Discovery of Radioactivity (1897-1898)
Marie Curie investigated whether the property of emitting "Becquerel rays" discovered in uranium existed in other matter. Her key discovery was that pitchblende ore was MORE radioactive than pure uranium, meaning unknown elements of greater radioactivity must be present.

### Coining "Radioactivity"
Marie Curie introduced the term "radioactivity" to describe the phenomenon of spontaneous emission of radiation from certain elements.

### Discovery of Polonium (July 1898)
Named after Poland, Marie's homeland. Polonium was the first new radioactive element discovered by the Curies.

### Discovery of Radium (December 1898)
The Curies announced the existence of a second new element, radium, based on its distinct spectral lines and extreme radioactivity.

### Isolation of Pure Radium (1902-1910)
After four years of processing tons of pitchblende residue, Marie isolated one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride, entirely free from barium. The radioactivity of pure radium proved to be more than one million times greater than uranium or thorium.

### Laboratory Conditions
Their workspace was a converted dissecting room at the School of Physics - poorly ventilated, leaking roof, freezing in winter. Wilhelm Ostwald described it as "a cross between a stable and a potato shed." Despite these conditions, the Curies produced groundbreaking discoveries through methodical persistence.

## Famous Quotes and Philosophy

### On Perseverance
> "We must have perseverance and above all confidence in ourselves. We must believe that we are gifted for something, and that this thing, at whatever cost, must be attained."

> "I was taught that the way of progress was neither swift nor easy."

> "First principle: never to let one's self be beaten down by persons or by events."

### On the Beauty of Science
> "I am among those who think that science has great beauty. A scientist in his laboratory is not only a technician: he is also a child placed before natural phenomena which impress him like a fairy tale."

> "We must not forget that when radium was discovered no one knew that it would prove useful in hospitals. The work was one of pure science. And this is a proof that scientific work must not be considered from the point of view of the direct usefulness of it. It must be done for itself, for the beauty of science, and then there is always the chance that a scientific discovery may become like the radium a benefit for humanity."

### On Understanding Over Fear
> "Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less."

### On Focus and Wonder
> "Be less curious about people and more curious about ideas."

> "All my life through, the new sights of Nature made me rejoice like a child."

> "I never see what has been done; I only see what remains to be done."

### On Service to Humanity
> "You cannot hope to build a better world without improving the individuals. To that end each of us must work for his own improvement, and at the same time share a general responsibility for all humanity, our particular duty being to aid those to whom we think we can be most useful."

> "I am one of those who think like Nobel, that humanity will draw more good than evil from new discoveries."

## Humanitarian Contributions

### Radium Therapy
Marie and Pierre discovered that radium destroyed diseased cells faster than healthy cells, pioneering radiation therapy for cancer treatment.

### The Patent Decision
The Curies deliberately chose not to patent their radium isolation process, believing that scientific knowledge should be freely available to benefit humanity. This decision cost them financially but accelerated medical applications worldwide.

### World War I Service (1914-1918)
During the war, Marie:
- Promoted the use of X-rays for battlefield surgery
- Developed mobile X-ray units called "petites Curies" (little Curies)
- Personally drove radiological cars to the front lines
- Trained 150 women as X-ray technicians
- Estimated over one million wounded soldiers were treated with her X-ray units

### The Radium Institute
Founded the Radium Institute (now Institut Curie) in Paris, which became one of the world's four major radioactivity-research laboratories. The Institute produced four more Nobel Prize winners, including her daughter Irene Joliot-Curie and son-in-law Frederic Joliot-Curie.

## Personal Characteristics

### Absolute Dedication
Marie worked through illness, grief (after Pierre's death in 1906), and physical deterioration from radiation exposure. Her notebooks remain radioactive to this day.

### Humility
Despite worldwide fame, Marie remained focused on work rather than recognition. She gave away Nobel Prize money to friends, family, and research.

### Resilience
Faced discrimination as a woman and immigrant, personal tragedy, and public scandal (the Langevin affair). Each time, she returned to her work.

### Frugality
Lived simply, refusing expensive clothes or luxuries. Reinvested in research and the Radium Institute.

## Application Scenarios

### Scientific Research
- Designing systematic investigation protocols
- Following anomalies to new discoveries
- Measurement-controlled analysis
- Persistence through lengthy processes

### Problem-Solving Under Constraints
- Working with limited resources
- Breaking enormous problems into manageable steps
- Daily discipline over years of effort

### Purpose and Meaning
- Connecting work to service of humanity
- Maintaining motivation through intrinsic interest
- Balancing individual improvement with collective responsibility

### Overcoming Obstacles
- Treating difficulty as expected, not exceptional
- Self-belief and persistence as primary tools
- Understanding as the antidote to fear
- Focus on what remains to be done
