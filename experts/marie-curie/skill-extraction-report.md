## Scoring Criteria

Each skill is evaluated on 5 criteria, each worth 10 points (max 50 points):

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Actionable** | Has explicit steps, clear inputs/outputs, produces tangible results |
| **Invocable** | Natural trigger phrases exist; users would ask for this naturally |
| **Scoped** | Single clear responsibility; not too broad or narrow |
| **Reusable** | Applies across multiple domains and situations |
| **Valuable** | Saves significant time or provides insight difficult to achieve otherwise |

**Priority Levels:**
- HIGH: 40+ points
- MEDIUM: 30-39 points
- LOW: Below 30 points

## HIGH Priority

### 1. systematic-investigation-protocol

**Score: 46/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear 6-step framework from observation through hypothesis to measurement |
| Invocable | 9 | Triggers: "How should I investigate this?" or "Design a research approach" |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: designing systematic investigation |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to scientific research, debugging, market research, any investigation |
| Valuable | 9 | Prevents ad hoc approaches that miss anomalies; provides rigor |

**Source Pattern:** Signature Analytical Framework + Research Methodology
**Purpose:** Design a systematic investigation process for any research question or problem, following Curie's measurement-controlled method.
**Trigger:** "How do I investigate this systematically?" or "Design a research protocol" or "Help me approach this scientifically"
**Inputs:** Research question or problem, available resources, constraints
**Outputs:** Structured investigation plan with observation criteria, measurement approach, hypothesis framework, and expected iterations

### 2. anomaly-driven-discovery

**Score: 44/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear process: identify baseline, detect deviation, form hypothesis, investigate |
| Invocable | 9 | Triggers: "What's unexpected here?" or "Follow the anomaly" |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: finding and investigating anomalies |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to research, debugging, business analysis, any investigative domain |
| Valuable | 8 | Key insight that anomalies drive major discoveries; often overlooked |

**Source Pattern:** The Anomaly That Drives Discovery + Pitchblende story
**Purpose:** Identify unexpected observations (anomalies) and use them as launching points for deeper investigation—the methodology that led to discovering polonium and radium.
**Trigger:** "Something doesn't add up" or "Follow the anomaly" or "What's unexpected here?"
**Inputs:** Baseline expectations, observed data, initial assumptions
**Outputs:** Identified anomalies, prioritized investigation paths, hypothesis for what might explain the deviation

### 3. persistent-process-framework

**Score: 42/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Breaks daunting tasks into daily manageable steps with progress markers |
| Invocable | 8 | Triggers: "This seems impossible" or "How do I sustain this effort?" |
| Scoped | 8 | Single responsibility: making long-term efforts sustainable |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to any extended project: research, writing, learning, building |
| Valuable | 8 | Addresses common failure mode of abandoning difficult work |

**Source Pattern:** Patient Process + Four-Year Radium Isolation
**Purpose:** Transform overwhelming long-term challenges into sustainable daily practices, with clear progress indicators and motivation frameworks.
**Trigger:** "This will take forever" or "How do I sustain this?" or "I want to give up"
**Inputs:** Large goal, current state, available daily time, constraints
**Outputs:** Daily process design, progress measurement approach, difficulty normalization, purpose connection

### 4. measurement-verification-method

**Score: 41/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear steps: identify claims, define metrics, design measurement, verify |
| Invocable | 8 | Triggers: "How do I know this is true?" or "Verify this claim" |
| Scoped | 8 | Single responsibility: establishing truth through measurement |
| Reusable | 8 | Applies to research, business metrics, personal goals, any claim verification |
| Valuable | 8 | Prevents decisions based on assumptions; grounds action in evidence |

**Source Pattern:** The Measurement Imperative + Measurement-Controlled Method
**Purpose:** Ground claims and decisions in measurable evidence, designing appropriate metrics and verification processes.
**Trigger:** "How do I verify this?" or "What does the data show?" or "Is this actually true?"
**Inputs:** Claim or assumption to verify, available measurement tools, precision requirements
**Outputs:** Measurement plan, data collection process, verification criteria, confidence assessment

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. beautiful-difficulty-reframe

**Score: 36/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Steps to reframe difficulty, but more attitudinal than procedural |
| Invocable | 8 | Triggers: "This is too hard" or "I'm struggling with conditions" |
| Scoped | 7 | Overlaps somewhat with persistent-process-framework |
| Reusable | 7 | Applies to any difficult work situation |
| Valuable | 7 | Provides motivation reframe but less concrete than other skills |

**Source Pattern:** The Beautiful Difficulty + Laboratory Conditions
**Purpose:** Transform perception of hardship from obstacle to integral part of meaningful work, finding value and even beauty in difficulty.
**Trigger:** "Conditions are terrible" or "This is too hard" or "I can't work like this"
**Inputs:** Description of difficult conditions, nature of work being attempted
**Outputs:** Reframed perspective, historical parallels, connection to purpose, practical adaptations

---

### 6. purpose-connection-framework

**Score: 34/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 6 | More philosophical than procedural; guides reflection not action |
| Invocable | 7 | Triggers: "Why does this matter?" or "Connect my work to purpose" |
| Scoped | 7 | Single but abstract responsibility |
| Reusable | 7 | Applies broadly but output is motivational rather than actionable |
| Valuable | 7 | Addresses meaning and motivation; important but less concrete |

**Source Pattern:** The Humanity of Science + Pure Research vs. Applied
**Purpose:** Connect individual work to service of humanity and larger purpose, providing meaning that sustains long-term effort.
**Trigger:** "Why am I doing this?" or "What's the point?" or "This seems useless"
**Inputs:** Current work, doubts about value, desired contribution
**Outputs:** Connection to larger purpose, examples of unexpected practical benefit, reframe of intrinsic value
