## Notes

- **Nobel Prize Records:** Marie Curie remains the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different sciences (Physics and Chemistry). Linus Pauling won two Nobels (Chemistry and Peace), but Peace is not a science category.

- **Patent Decision:** The Curies' deliberate choice not to patent the radium isolation process is well-documented. This accelerated medical applications worldwide but left them without significant income from their discovery.

- **Pierre Curie's Death:** Pierre died on April 19, 1906, when he was run over by a horse-drawn cart in a Paris street. Marie was devastated but continued their work, taking over his teaching position at the Sorbonne.

- **Radiation Exposure:** Her notebooks and personal effects remain highly radioactive and are kept in lead-lined boxes. Researchers who wish to view them must wear protective clothing and sign a waiver.
