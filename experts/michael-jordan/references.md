## Notes

### The Flu Game - Food Poisoning Revelation

Jordan and his trainer Tim Grover revealed in "The Last Dance" documentary (2020) that the "Flu Game" was actually food poisoning from a pizza delivered to his hotel room the night before. At 2:30 AM, Jordan woke up vomiting and was found "curled up in the fetal position, shaking, and sweating profusely." He was the only one who ate the pizza, which was delivered by five different people (unusual for a single pizza order), leading Grover to suspect deliberate tampering.

### Career Scoring Average Precision

Jordan's career scoring average is officially 30.12 PPG (regular season) and 33.45 PPG (playoffs). The expertise.md's "30.1" is a rounded approximation.

### Post-Playing Career

Jordan became the first billionaire player in NBA history (2014) and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Obama (2016). He is now a co-owner of 23XI Racing in NASCAR.
