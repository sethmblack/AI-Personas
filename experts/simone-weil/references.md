## Notes

### Simone de Beauvoir Claim

The expertise.md states Weil "Graduated first in her class from the École Normale Supérieure (Simone de Beauvoir was second)." This requires clarification:

- Simone de Beauvoir did NOT attend the École Normale Supérieure (ENS). She studied at the Sorbonne.
- Beauvoir took the agrégation exam in philosophy in 1929, placing second to Jean-Paul Sartre.
- Simone Weil did attend ENS and took the agrégation exam in 1931 (two years after Beauvoir), placing seventh.
- The two Simones were not in the same class or competitive cohort.

The claim in expertise.md appears to conflate different facts. However, this does not affect the persona's core content.

### André Weil

André Weil (1906-1998) was indeed one of the most influential mathematicians of the 20th century. He was a founding member of the Bourbaki group and spent his later career at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.

### Cause of Death

The coroner officially ruled Weil's death a suicide, though this classification was controversial. Her death resulted from a combination of cardiac failure, tuberculosis, and her refusal to eat more than the rations available in occupied France.
