## Key Works

### Gravity and Grace (La Pesanteur et la Grâce) - 1947
Posthumous collection of aphorisms and reflections compiled by Gustave Thibon from her notebooks. Her most famous work, exploring the tension between the downward pull of selfishness (gravity) and the supernatural lift of divine love (grace).

**Core themes:**
- Gravity as the natural tendency toward the self, the automatic, the mechanical
- Grace as the only force that lifts the soul beyond mere nature
- The void as necessary condition for receiving grace
- Affliction as spiritual crucible
- Decreation as path to union with the divine

### Waiting for God (Attente de Dieu) - 1950
Spiritual autobiography in the form of letters to Father Joseph-Marie Perrin. Explains why she remained outside the Church despite her profound Christian mysticism.

**Core themes:**
- The concept of "waiting" as active attention rather than passive expectation
- Decreation—the undoing of the self to make room for God
- Why she refused baptism despite her faith
- The encounter with Christ through poetry (George Herbert's "Love")
- The universal presence of the divine beyond institutional religion

### The Need for Roots (L'Enracinement) - 1949
Written for the Free French government-in-exile, a meditation on the obligations of the state to the individual and the spiritual foundations of a just society.

**Core themes:**
- Uprootedness as the central disease of modernity
- The needs of the soul: order, liberty, obedience, responsibility, equality, hierarchy, honor, punishment, freedom of opinion, security, risk, private property, collective property, truth
- Work as potentially sacred when it engages the whole person
- The spiritual bankruptcy of both capitalism and communism
- How France might be spiritually renewed after the war

### The Iliad, or the Poem of Force (L'Iliade ou le poème de la force) - 1939-1940
Essay analyzing Homer's epic as a meditation on the dehumanizing effects of violence on both victor and victim.

**Core themes:**
- Force as that which turns a human being into a thing
- The equality of Greeks and Trojans under the weight of war
- Brief moments of grace and humanity amid brutality
- The absence of vengeance in Homer's even-handed portrayal
- War as revealing the fundamental nature of force

### Oppression and Liberty (Oppression et Liberté) - 1955
Political and philosophical essays examining the nature of oppression, the failures of Marxism, and the conditions for genuine liberty.

**Core themes:**
- Critique of Marx from the left—analyzing why revolution often reproduces oppression
- The relationship between power, bureaucracy, and dehumanization
- Technology and the organization of work as sources of modern slavery
- Conditions for meaningful rather than alienated labor
- The spiritual dimension of political liberation

### Factory Journal (La Condition ouvrière) - 1951
Diary of her year working in factories (1934-1935), including reflections on the experience and proposals for reform.

**Core themes:**
- The experience of factory work as humiliation and enslavement
- Physical exhaustion as spiritual crisis
- Why workers are docile rather than rebellious
- Proposals for reforming work to restore human dignity
- The gap between intellectual understanding and embodied experience

## Famous Quotations

### On Attention
> "Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity."

> "Absolutely unmixed attention is prayer."

> "The love of our neighbor in all its fullness simply means being able to say, 'What are you going through?'"

### On Affliction and Suffering
> "Human beings are so made that the ones who do the crushing feel nothing; it is the person crushed who feels what is happening. Unless one has placed oneself on the side of the oppressed, to feel with them, one cannot understand."

> "Pain and suffering are a kind of currency passed from hand to hand until they reach someone who receives them but does not pass them on."

> "It is better to say, 'I am suffering,' than to say, 'This landscape is ugly.'"

> "Affliction causes God to be absent for a time, more absent than a dead man."

### On Grace and the Void
> "Grace fills empty spaces, but it can only enter where there is a void to receive it, and it is grace itself which makes this void."

> "We must not wish for the disappearance of our troubles but for the grace to transform them."

> "Love of God is pure when joy and suffering inspire an equal degree of gratitude."

### On Work and the Oppressed
> "Workers need poetry more than bread. They need that their life should be a poem. They need some light from eternity."

> "To be rooted is perhaps the most important and least recognized need of the human soul."

> "Every being cries out silently to be read differently."

### On Force and Justice
> "If we know in what way society is unbalanced, we must do what we can to add weight to the lighter scale."

> "Justice. To be ever ready to admit that another person is something quite different from what we read when he is there."

> "It is an eternal obligation toward the human being not to let him suffer from hunger when one has a chance of coming to his assistance."

### On Faith and Spiritual Life
> "Humanism was not wrong in thinking that truth, beauty, liberty, and equality are of infinite value, but in thinking that man can get them for himself without grace."

> "I can, therefore, only conceive of one manner of prayer—attention to God."

> "He who has not God in himself cannot feel His absence."
