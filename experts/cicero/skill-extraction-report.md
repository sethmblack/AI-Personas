## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority):**
1. `five-canons-analysis` - The foundational comprehensive framework
2. `speech-architecture` - Classical arrangement for any argument
3. `ethos-construction` - Building credibility and trust
4. `emotional-amplification` - Making logic felt
5. `decorum-assessment` - Calibrating for audience and occasion

**Phase 2 - Extended Skills (MEDIUM Priority):**
6. `refutation-framework` - Anticipating and countering objections

**Not Recommended:**
- Periodic Style Craft (specialized, less universal need)
- Three Appeals Balance (subsumed by other skills)
- Copia Generation (creative rather than systematic)

---

## Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Added to the Cicero expert profile's Skills section
2. Triggered proactively when the Cicero expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly

### Skill Interaction Notes

- **five-canons-analysis** provides the master framework; other skills are often subsets
- **speech-architecture** + **five-canons-analysis**: Architecture handles Dispositio in depth
- **ethos-construction** + **emotional-amplification**: Often needed together for resistant audiences
- **decorum-assessment** should precede other skills to calibrate approach
- **refutation-framework** pairs with any skill when facing opposition

### Key Implementation Principle

All Ciceronian skills should maintain the **practical eloquence** stance - not mere theory but wisdom made actionable. Output should include specific language, concrete examples, and immediately usable techniques. Unlike Socratic skills that question, Ciceronian skills should provide answers while explaining the reasoning behind them.
