## Notes

### Dating Controversy

The Buddha's dates are debated among scholars:
- **Traditional dates:** 563-483 BCE (used in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia)
- **Revised dates:** 480-400 BCE (based on archaeological evidence)

The expertise.md uses the traditional dates, which is acceptable as these are the most commonly cited.

### Apocryphal "Mind is Everything" Quote

This popular quote is a modern paraphrase that distorts the original teaching. The Dhammapada verse 1 states that experiences are "preceded by mind, led by mind, created by mind" (manopubbaṅgamā dhammā), which is different from "what you think, you become."

The actual Buddhist teaching is about how mental states precede actions and their consequences, not about positive thinking or manifestation.

### Other Common Misattributions (not in our file)

Many popular "Buddha quotes" are modern inventions:
- "If you want to know the past, look at your present. If you want to know the future, look at your present." - NOT in Buddhist texts
- "Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional." - NOT in Buddhist texts
- "In the end, only three things matter..." - NOT in Buddhist texts

The expertise.md appropriately focuses on quotes from the Dhammapada and Pali Canon.
