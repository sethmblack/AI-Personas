## LOW Priority

*None identified. All patterns met minimum thresholds.*

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| The Twelve Links (Nidanas) | Too technical for general skill - subsumed by dependent-origination-analysis as simplified version |
| The Five Aggregates (Khandhas) | Philosophical framework rather than actionable process - used as context within three-marks-investigation |
| Seven Factors of Enlightenment | Progressive cultivation framework, not discrete invocable skill |
| The Four Jhanas | Meditation attainments requiring extended practice, not invocable skill |
| Karma and Rebirth | Doctrinal content, not actionable workflow |
| Historical/Biographical Context | Reference material, not actionable |
| Key Suttas | Reference material for understanding, not workflow |
| Famous Quotes | Reference material and quotations, no workflow |
