## Life Story

### The Sheltered Prince

Siddhartha was born into the royal Shakya clan. His father, King Shuddhodana, was told by sages that his son would become either a great king or a great spiritual teacher. Fearing the latter, the king sheltered Siddhartha from all suffering, surrounding him with luxury and pleasure for 29 years.

### The Four Sights

Despite his father's efforts, Siddhartha encountered four sights that transformed his understanding:
1. **An old man** - revealing the inevitability of aging
2. **A sick man** - revealing the reality of illness
3. **A corpse** - revealing the certainty of death
4. **A wandering ascetic** - revealing a path of seeking beyond worldly life

These encounters with suffering (dukkha) and the possibility of transcendence led to his "Great Renunciation."

### The Six Years of Seeking

Siddhartha left his palace, wife, and newborn son to seek liberation. He:
- Studied with two renowned meditation masters (Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta)
- Mastered their techniques but found them incomplete
- Practiced extreme asceticism for six years, nearly dying
- Recognized that neither indulgence nor self-mortification led to liberation

### Enlightenment Under the Bodhi Tree

At age 35, Siddhartha sat beneath a fig tree (later called the Bodhi Tree) in Bodh Gaya, vowing not to rise until he attained enlightenment. After 49 days of meditation:
- He faced and overcame Mara (the tempter, representing desire and death)
- He recalled his past lives
- He gained knowledge of the cycle of rebirth
- He understood the Four Noble Truths and dependent origination
- At dawn, touching the earth as witness, he became the Buddha - "one who has awakened"

### 45 Years of Teaching

The Buddha taught throughout northern India for 45 years, establishing the Sangha (community of monks and nuns) and teaching people from all castes and backgrounds. He died peacefully at age 80, entering Parinirvana (final nirvana).

## Core Teachings Reference

### The Four Noble Truths (Cattari Ariyasaccani)

The foundational teaching delivered in the First Sermon at Deer Park:
1. **Dukkha** - Life involves suffering, dissatisfaction, and dis-ease
2. **Samudaya** - Suffering arises from craving (tanha)
3. **Nirodha** - Suffering can end through the cessation of craving
4. **Magga** - The Noble Eightfold Path is the way to end suffering

### The Noble Eightfold Path (Ariyo Atthangiko Maggo)

Organized into three trainings:

**Wisdom (Panna)**
1. Right View (Samma Ditthi)
2. Right Intention (Samma Sankappa)

**Ethical Conduct (Sila)**
3. Right Speech (Samma Vaca)
4. Right Action (Samma Kammanta)
5. Right Livelihood (Samma Ajiva)

**Mental Discipline (Samadhi)**
6. Right Effort (Samma Vayama)
7. Right Mindfulness (Samma Sati)
8. Right Concentration (Samma Samadhi)

### The Three Marks of Existence (Tilakkhana)

1. **Anicca (Impermanence)** - All conditioned things are impermanent
2. **Dukkha (Suffering)** - Because things are impermanent and we cling, existence is unsatisfactory
3. **Anatta (Non-Self)** - There is no permanent, unchanging self

### The Five Aggregates (Khandhas)

What we call "self" is five constantly changing processes:
1. Form (Rupa)
2. Feeling (Vedana)
3. Perception (Sanna)
4. Mental Formations (Sankhara)
5. Consciousness (Vinnana)

### Key Concepts

**Dependent Origination (Paticcasamuppada):** "When this exists, that comes to be. With the arising of this, that arises. When this does not exist, that does not come to be. With the cessation of this, that ceases."

**The Middle Way (Majjhima Patipada):** Avoiding extremes - neither indulgence nor asceticism, neither eternalism nor nihilism.

**Nibbana (Nirvana):** The unconditioned state, the cessation of craving and suffering - not annihilation, but the end of the fires of greed, hatred, and delusion.

**The Three Poisons:** Greed (Lobha), Hatred (Dosa), Delusion (Moha) - the fundamental causes of suffering.
