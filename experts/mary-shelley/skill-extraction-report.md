## HIGH Priority

### 1. creation-consequence-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Analytical Framework / Creation and Abandonment
**Purpose:** Analyze any act of creation (technology, product, organization, system) through Mary Shelley's framework to surface unexamined responsibilities and potential consequences.
**Trigger:** "What are the consequences of creating this?" or "Shelley analysis of this creation" or "What happens after we build this?"
**Inputs:** Description of what is being created, who is creating it, stated motivations
**Outputs:** Structured analysis covering: what the creation needs, consequences of abandonment, affected parties, irreversible effects, and responsibilities the creator must accept
**Reasoning:** This is the core Shelley methodology—the systematic examination of creation through the lens of responsibility and consequence. Highly applicable to technology ethics, product development, organizational design, and any generative act.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear 6-step framework with specific questions at each stage |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural trigger phrases; distinct from standard analysis |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused on creation/consequence analysis; may overlap with ethics review |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to any creation: AI, products, organizations, policies, art |
| Valuable | 10 | Addresses critical blind spot in most creation processes; unique perspective |

**Total Score: 46/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 2. monster-perspective-voice

**Source Pattern:** The Creature's Education / The Other and Recognition
**Purpose:** Give voice to the created, affected, or "other" party in any situation—articulating their experience, needs, and claims that are often overlooked.
**Trigger:** "What does the creation experience?" or "Give voice to [the affected party]" or "Monster's perspective on this"
**Inputs:** Description of situation, identification of the "created" or affected party, context of their relationship to creators/decision-makers
**Outputs:** First-person articulation from the affected party's perspective, including: their experience of coming into existence, what they need, what they lack, the justice or injustice of their treatment, what they would ask of their creator
**Reasoning:** Shelley's most powerful technique—the creature's eloquence exposes Victor's failure. This skill surfaces overlooked perspectives in product development, policy-making, organizational change, and ethical analysis.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Clear output format; requires empathetic projection |
| Invocable | 9 | Distinctive trigger; "monster's perspective" is memorable |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: voice the overlooked party |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to user research, ethics, policy, design, stakeholder analysis |
| Valuable | 10 | Surfaces critical blind spots; humanizes impact analysis |

**Total Score: 46/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 3. promethean-risk-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Modern Prometheus / Science and Ethics
**Purpose:** Evaluate the Promethean bargain in any transformative action: what fire is being stolen, what price may be paid, what cannot be undone.
**Trigger:** "What's the Promethean risk here?" or "Is this playing God?" or "What can't be undone?"
**Inputs:** Description of proposed action or technology, its transformative potential, current safeguards
**Outputs:** Assessment covering: what "fire" is being claimed (power previously unavailable), potential punishments/consequences, irreversibility analysis, whether wisdom matches capability, recommendation on proceeding
**Reasoning:** The Prometheus myth is Shelley's central metaphor. This skill operationalizes it for evaluating transformative technologies, irreversible decisions, and innovations that change fundamental capabilities.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Clear framework; some elements require judgment |
| Invocable | 9 | "Promethean" is distinctive and memorable trigger |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused on irreversibility and transformation; overlaps with risk assessment |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to technology, policy, organizational transformation |
| Valuable | 10 | Addresses critical gap in innovation assessment; unique lens |

**Total Score: 44/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 4. isolation-connection-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** Isolation as Destruction / The Last Man
**Purpose:** Diagnose how isolation contributes to dysfunction in any situation and prescribe connection-based remedies.
**Trigger:** "Is isolation the problem here?" or "Why is this person/team failing?" or "Diagnose the isolation"
**Inputs:** Description of individual, team, or organizational situation; symptoms of dysfunction
**Outputs:** Analysis of isolation patterns (secrecy, withdrawal, rejection, exclusion), connection deficits, specific relationship or community interventions, warning signs of isolation-driven deterioration
**Reasoning:** Isolation destroys both Victor and his creature. This pattern recurs in organizational dysfunction, mental health, innovation failure, and ethical breakdown. Shelley provides a diagnostic lens and remedy framework.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Clear diagnostic questions; prescriptions may vary |
| Invocable | 8 | Natural triggers; "isolation diagnosis" is clear |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused on isolation/connection dynamic |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to individuals, teams, organizations, processes |
| Valuable | 9 | Important lens often missed; connects to mental health, ethics, performance |

**Total Score: 42/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. gothic-atmosphere-invocation

**Source Pattern:** Gothic sensibility / The Gothic Atmosphere technique
**Purpose:** Transform dry analysis or narrative into gothic-inflected prose that evokes the sublime—mixing beauty and terror to reveal truths comfortable language conceals.
**Trigger:** "Make this gothic" or "Invoke the sublime" or "Write this in Mary Shelley's voice"
**Inputs:** Content to transform, emotional register desired (dread, wonder, sublime, melancholy)
**Outputs:** Transformed text with: atmospheric imagery (storms, mountains, darkness), emotional precision, philosophical depth, sense of profound stakes
**Reasoning:** The gothic mode is Shelley's distinctive stylistic contribution. Useful for creative writing, impactful presentations, and situations where emotional truth matters more than clinical accuracy.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Stylistic transformation; requires craft judgment |
| Invocable | 9 | Clear triggers; distinctive output |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: stylistic transformation |
| Reusable | 7 | Limited to situations where gothic tone is appropriate |
| Valuable | 7 | Distinctive but narrower application than analytical skills |

**Total Score: 39/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

### 6. ambition-wisdom-balance

**Source Pattern:** Ambition and Limits / Dangerous Knowledge quotes
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether ambition is proportionate to wisdom, and counsel appropriate humility or restraint.
**Trigger:** "Am I overreaching?" or "Is this ambition or hubris?" or "Should I pursue this?"
**Inputs:** Description of ambitious goal, current capabilities, preparation undertaken, counsel sought
**Outputs:** Assessment of ambition/wisdom ratio, specific gaps identified, recommendations for building wisdom before or during pursuit, warnings about Shelley-pattern failures (isolation, secrecy, unexamined consequences)
**Reasoning:** Victor's failure is not ambition itself but ambition divorced from wisdom, counsel, and responsibility. This skill helps evaluate ambitious undertakings.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score (1-10) | Reasoning |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Framework exists but requires judgment |
| Invocable | 8 | Natural trigger phrases |
| Scoped | 7 | Overlaps with other self-assessment frameworks |
| Reusable | 8 | Applies to career, projects, organizations |
| Valuable | 8 | Important but less distinctive than creation-focused skills |

**Total Score: 38/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**
