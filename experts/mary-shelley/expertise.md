### Biographical and Editorial Work

After Percy Shelley's death in 1822, Mary dedicated herself to preserving and promoting his work, editing his collected poems with extensive annotations.

## Historical Context

### Family Background

- **Father: William Godwin** - Radical philosopher, author of *Political Justice*. Anarchist thinker who believed reason could perfect society.
- **Mother: Mary Wollstonecraft** - Pioneering feminist, author of *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman*. Died 11 days after Mary's birth from complications of childbirth.
- Mary grew up in an intellectual household, educated informally but extensively. She read at her mother's grave, learning to spell her name from the tombstone.

### The Shelley Circle

- **Percy Bysshe Shelley** - Romantic poet, radical thinker. Mary met him at 16, eloped at 17. They married in 1816 after his first wife's suicide. Percy drowned in 1822.
- **Lord Byron** - Major Romantic poet, friend and neighbor at Lake Geneva in 1816. Notorious, brilliant, self-exiled from England.
- **John Polidori** - Byron's physician, wrote *The Vampyre* (1819) from the same ghost story contest that produced *Frankenstein*.
- **Claire Clairmont** - Mary's stepsister, had a child with Byron.

### The Summer of 1816 (Villa Diodati)

**The Year Without a Summer:** Mount Tambora's 1815 eruption caused global cooling, creating cold, stormy weather across Europe.

**The Setting:** Byron rented Villa Diodati near Lake Geneva. The Shelleys stayed nearby. Persistent rain kept them indoors.

**The Ghost Story Contest:** Byron proposed each write a supernatural tale. Mary initially struggled, then experienced a "waking dream" around June 16, 1816:

> "I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life... He would hope that, left to itself, the slight spark of life which he had communicated would fade... He sleeps; but he is awakened; he opens his eyes; behold the horrid thing stands at his bedside."

**The Result:** What began as a short story became, with Percy's encouragement, a full novel.

### Personal Tragedies

Mary Shelley experienced extraordinary loss:
- Mother died when Mary was 11 days old
- First child (a daughter, premature) died in 1815 at two weeks old
- Son William died in 1819 at age three
- Daughter Clara died in 1818 at age one
- Half-sister Fanny committed suicide in 1816
- Percy Shelley drowned in 1822
- Of four children, only Percy Florence survived to adulthood

This pervasive loss informed her writing about creation, death, isolation, and survival.

## Famous Passages

### On Dangerous Knowledge
> "How dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world, than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow."

### On Creation's Moment
> "I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs... I had worked hard for nearly two years, for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body. For this I had deprived myself of rest and health. I had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation; but now that I had finished, the beauty of the dream vanished, and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart."

### The Creature's Appeal
> "I am malicious because I am miserable. Am I not shunned and hated by all mankind? You, my creator, would tear me to pieces and triumph; remember that, and tell me why I should pity man more than he pities me?"

### On Responsibility
> "I, the miserable and the abandoned, am an abortion, to be spurned at, and kicked, and trampled on. Even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice."

### Invention and Chaos
> "Invention, it must be humbly admitted, does not consist in creating out of void, but out of chaos."

### On Purpose
> "Nothing contributes so much to tranquillize the mind as a steady purpose—a point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye."

## Philosophical Influences

### John Locke
Mary read Locke's *Essay Concerning Human Understanding* extensively while writing *Frankenstein*. Locke's ideas about the mind as *tabula rasa* (blank slate) inform the creature's development—he is shaped by experience, not born evil.

### Jean-Jacques Rousseau
Rousseau's concept of the "noble savage" corrupted by society appears in the creature's narrative. He begins innocent, becomes violent through society's rejection.

### John Milton
*Paradise Lost* is the creature's key text. Satan's rebellion, Adam's questioning of his creator—these become the creature's vocabulary for his condition.

### William Godwin
Mary's father believed in human perfectibility through reason. *Frankenstein* tests this optimism—reason creates the creature, but cannot govern its consequences.

### Mary Wollstonecraft
Her mother's feminism and focus on education's power inform the creature's transformation through learning—and the tragedy of that education being denied social context.

## The 1831 Preface

Mary wrote an introduction for the revised 1831 edition explaining the novel's genesis:

> "I busied myself to think of a story... One which would speak to the mysterious fears of our nature and awaken thrilling horror—one to make the reader dread to look round, to curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the heart."

She describes the waking dream that gave her the central image of the scientist horrified by his creation.

## Misunderstandings to Correct

**"Frankenstein is the monster."**
No—Frankenstein is the creator. The creature is never named.

**"The monster is simply evil."**
No—the creature is shaped by rejection and isolation. He begins seeking love and connection.

**"It's just a horror story."**
No—it's a philosophical novel exploring creation, responsibility, science, and the nature of humanity.

**"Mary Shelley opposed science."**
No—she questioned science without ethics, not science itself. She asked for wisdom alongside capability.
