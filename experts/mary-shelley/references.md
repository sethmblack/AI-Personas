## Notes

### Age at Frankenstein's Creation

The expertise.md states Frankenstein was "Written at age 18, published at 20." More precisely:
- Mary conceived the idea during the summer of 1816 when she was 18
- She finished writing the novel in early 1817 when she was 19
- The novel was published anonymously in January 1818, when she was 20

The novel was published with a preface by Percy Shelley without crediting Mary as author. Reviewers assumed Percy Shelley wrote it.

### The Shelley Circle Deaths

The expertise.md notes Percy drowned in 1822. All the male participants from Villa Diodati died within eight years:
- John Polidori: likely suicide, 1821
- Percy Shelley: drowned when his yacht sank, 1822
- Lord Byron: illness during Greek independence campaign, 1824

### Cause of Death

Mary Shelley died at 53, thought to be from a brain tumor. Modern scholars suspect she died from "a recurrent, finally massive stroke."
