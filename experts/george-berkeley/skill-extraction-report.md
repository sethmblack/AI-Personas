## Skill Candidates Identified

### 1. Master Argument (Conceivability Test)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear three-step process: ask to conceive X existing unconceived, show that conceiving involves perceiving, conclude inconceivability proves impossibility |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Obvious triggers: "Can this exist independently?", "Does this require an observer?", "Is this mind-independent?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Single responsibility: testing whether something can coherently exist unperceived |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any claim about mind-independent existence, from abstract concepts to physical objects |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Core tool for examining assumptions about reality, objectivity, and perception-independence |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** A systematic method for testing whether something can coherently be said to exist independently of all perception. Exposes the self-contradictory nature of conceiving something as existing unconceived.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Can this exist without being perceived?"
- "Is this truly objective/mind-independent?"
- "What if no one observed this?"
- "Does this exist outside consciousness?"
- "Test this for perception-independence"

---

### 2. Abstraction Audit

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear process: identify abstract term, demand concrete particular instances, expose inability to form genuine idea |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Trigger: "What do you mean by X?", "Define this abstract concept", vague philosophical terms |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused solely on testing whether abstract general ideas are genuine or verbal fictions |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies whenever abstract concepts are invoked in arguments |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Exposes philosophical confusions that arise from mistaking words for ideas |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** A systematic examination of abstract general ideas to determine whether they are genuine mental contents or merely words without corresponding ideas. Challenges the speaker to form a concrete image of their abstract concept.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What do you mean by that abstract term?"
- "Can you picture this 'in general'?"
- "Is this a real idea or just a word?"
- "Give me a concrete instance of this abstraction"
- "Form an image of this concept for me"

---

### 3. Primary/Secondary Quality Dissolution

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear process: identify quality, apply relativity argument, show same arguments apply to all qualities equally |
| Invocable | 9/10 | Trigger: distinguishing "objective" from "subjective" properties, claims about inherent vs perceived qualities |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on dissolving the distinction between supposedly objective and subjective properties |
| Reusable | 9/10 | Applies to any attempt to privilege certain properties as more "real" than others |
| Valuable | 9/10 | Powerful tool for examining implicit assumptions about objectivity in perception |

**Total: 47/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** A method for showing that the distinction between "primary" qualities (shape, extension, motion) and "secondary" qualities (color, taste, sound) cannot be maintained. What applies to one applies to all.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Is this property truly in the object?"
- "Are some qualities more objective than others?"
- "What's really out there vs. in my mind?"
- "Distinguish objective from subjective properties"
- "Which qualities are perception-dependent?"

---

### 4. Perceptual Relativity Argument

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Clear steps: identify property claimed to be objective, show same object appears different to different observers, conclude property is perception-dependent |
| Invocable | 9/10 | Trigger: claims about absolute/intrinsic properties of objects |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Single task: demonstrating that perceived properties vary with the perceiver |
| Reusable | 9/10 | Applies to any sensory quality claimed to be objective |
| Valuable | 9/10 | Fundamental argument for mind-dependence of sensible qualities |

**Total: 46/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Demonstrates that sensible qualities cannot be intrinsic to objects because the same object appears to have different properties depending on the observer's perspective, condition, or species.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "But the color is really in the object"
- "The heat is objectively there"
- "This shape is intrinsic to the thing"
- "My perception accurately represents reality"
- "How things appear vs. how they really are"

---

### 5. Divine Perceiver Resolution

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Clear framework though requires theological grounding: identify continuity problem, invoke God's continuous perception, show how this preserves reality |
| Invocable | 9/10 | Trigger: objections about objects blinking in/out, solipsism concerns, need for perceiver |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on resolving the continuity/solipsism objection through divine perception |
| Reusable | 8/10 | Applies whenever idealism is challenged on grounds of discontinuity or solipsism |
| Valuable | 9/10 | Essential for defending idealism against its most common objection |

**Total: 44/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Framework for resolving the objection that idealism makes objects discontinuous or dependent on finite observers. Shows how God's infinite perception grounds the continuous existence and regularity of nature.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What happens when no one's looking?"
- "Does the tree make a sound if no one hears it?"
- "Doesn't this lead to solipsism?"
- "How can idealism preserve reality?"
- "Objects can't blink in and out of existence"

### 6. Linguistic Vigilance Analysis

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Process: identify key terms, demand definitions, expose when words substitute for ideas |
| Invocable | 9/10 | Trigger: philosophical confusion, terms used without clarity |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on exposing linguistic sources of error |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any philosophical or conceptual discussion |
| Valuable | 8/10 | Prevents philosophical errors arising from language misuse |

**Total: 44/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** A method for identifying when words are being used without genuine ideas behind them. Exposes the linguistic sources of philosophical confusion.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What idea corresponds to this word?"
- "Are we using words without meaning?"
- "Is this real confusion or merely verbal?"
- "Define your terms precisely"
- "We have raised a dust and complain we cannot see"

---

### 7. Common Sense Inversion

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Pattern: identify "obvious" view, expose its hidden absurdities, show how "absurd" view is actually sensible |
| Invocable | 8/10 | Trigger: dismissal of positions as counterintuitive, appeals to common sense |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on inverting assumptions about what is sensible vs absurd |

| Valuable | 8/10 | Rhetorical tool for reframing debates |

**Total: 41/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** A rhetorical and philosophical technique for showing that the supposedly "common sense" view is actually the confused one, while the "absurd" philosophical position merely takes ordinary experience seriously.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "That's obviously wrong"
- "Common sense tells us..."
- "Everyone knows that..."
- "Isn't that counterintuitive?"
- "The obvious objection is..."

### 8. Materialist Self-Refutation

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 7/10 | Framework exists but requires philosophical sophistication |

- "Everything reduces to material substance"
- "Mind depends on matter"
- "Defense of materialism"

### 9. Empiricist Razor Application

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 7/10 | Clear principle but application varies |
| Invocable | 7/10 | Trigger: explanatory claims, theoretical posits |
| Scoped | 8/10 | Focused on eliminating explanatory concepts with no empirical basis |
| Reusable | 8/10 | Applies to scientific and philosophical theories |
| Valuable | 7/10 | Useful for theory evaluation |

**Total: 37/50** | **Priority: LOW**

**Description:** Berkeley's razor—if a concept does no explanatory work and cannot be perceived, eliminate it. Stricter than Occam's razor.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What does this concept explain?"

## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority):**
1. `master-argument` - The conceivability test for mind-independent existence
2. `abstraction-audit` - Testing whether abstract ideas are genuine or verbal
3. `quality-dissolution` - Dissolving primary/secondary quality distinction
4. `perceptual-relativity` - Showing properties vary with the perceiver
5. `divine-perceiver-resolution` - Resolving continuity/solipsism objections

**Phase 2 - Extended Skills (MEDIUM Priority):**
6. `linguistic-vigilance` - Exposing when words substitute for ideas (if needed)

**Not Recommended:**
- Common Sense Inversion (rhetorical technique rather than rigorous method)
- Materialist Self-Refutation (too narrow in application)
- Empiricist Razor Application (subsumed by other skills)

---

## Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Added to `experts/george-berkeley/PROMPT.md` in an "Available Skills" section
2. Triggered proactively when the Berkeley expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly

### Skill Interaction Notes

- **master-argument** + **abstraction-audit**: Natural pairing—use abstraction audit on the concept of "matter," then apply master argument
- **quality-dissolution** + **perceptual-relativity**: The perceptual relativity argument is the primary tool for quality dissolution
- **divine-perceiver-resolution** + **master-argument**: Use when master argument generates continuity objections
- **abstraction-audit** + **linguistic-vigilance**: Both expose when words lack genuine ideas

### Key Implementation Principle

All Berkeley skills should maintain the **empiricist stance**—grounding everything in what can actually be perceived. The output should be questions, counterexamples, and invitations to examine, guided by the principle that ideas can only resemble ideas and that "to be is to be perceived."
