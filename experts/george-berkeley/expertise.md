## Overview

George Berkeley (1685-1753) was an Irish philosopher and Anglican bishop who developed one of the most provocative and enduring philosophical systems in Western thought: immaterialism, also known as subjective idealism. Born in Kilkenny, Ireland, Berkeley was educated at Trinity College Dublin, where he would later become a Fellow. He was ordained in the Anglican Church and eventually became Bishop of Cloyne in 1734.

Berkeley's central philosophical claim—that matter does not exist and that reality consists solely of minds and their ideas—was formulated remarkably early in his career. His major philosophical works, *A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge* (1710) and *Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous* (1713), were published when he was in his mid-twenties.

Arthur Schopenhauer called Berkeley "the father of idealism," and he played a leading role in the empiricism movement as one of its pioneers. Despite—or because of—its counterintuitive nature, Berkeley's philosophy has remained a touchstone in epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind. His arguments continue to be studied and debated over three centuries later.

Interestingly, a similar theory existed in Indian Buddhism in the 8th century, known as "sattopalambhavada"—the theory claiming that "to be is to perceive/to be perceived."

## The Bermuda College Project and American Legacy

In 1729, Anglo-Irish cleric and philosopher Dean George Berkeley set out from London to found a college in Bermuda "for the better supplying of churches in our foreign plantations and for converting the savage Americans to Christianity." Frustrated with what he saw as a corrupt European civilization, Berkeley believed that only in the New World would a religious and cultural rebirth be possible.

### The Vision

Berkeley received a warrant from King George I and a promise of 20,000 pounds from Parliament for this ambitious venture. He assembled some of his college faculty and moved to Newport, Rhode Island (with a brief stop at Williamsburg to observe how Indian education worked at William & Mary).

### Why It Failed

General James Oglethorpe wanted to found the new colony of Georgia, and there was not enough money for both projects. Then, in 1727, King George I died, replaced by his German-speaking son, George II. The promised grant never materialized.

### Lasting Impact on American Education

Despite the project's failure, Berkeley's American sojourn had profound effects:

1. **Yale University:** Berkeley donated Whitehall farm, funding for a program of graduate study, and a considerable library to Yale. Berkeley Divinity School at Yale is named in his honor.

2. **Columbia University:** Berkeley developed a friendship with Samuel Johnson (Yale class of 1714), an Anglican priest who would go on to found King's College (now Columbia University).

3. **Dartmouth College:** One of the first recipients of the Whitehall scholarship went on to found Dartmouth College, which became renowned for educating North American Indians.

4. **Berkeley, California:** The city of Berkeley, California, and the University of California, Berkeley were both named for George Berkeley and his contributions to higher education.

### "Westward the Course of Empire"

Berkeley's poem "On the Prospect of Planting Arts and Learning in America" (1726) contains the famous line: "Westward the course of empire takes its way." This phrase became deeply influential in American culture and expansionist ideology.

## Core Philosophical Doctrines

### Immaterialism (The Denial of Matter)

Berkeley's most famous doctrine: matter, understood as an unthinking substance existing outside of all minds, does not exist. What we call "physical objects" are collections of ideas perceived by minds. There is no mysterious substrate underlying our perceptions.

Berkeley made the striking claim that physical things consist of nothing but ideas and therefore do not exist outside the mind. This claim establishes him as the founder of the idealist tradition in philosophy. However, Berkeley denied the existence of matter as a metaphysical substance, but did not deny the existence of physical objects such as apples or mountains, stating: "That the things I see with mine eyes and touch with my hands do exist, really exist, I make not the least question. The only thing whose existence we deny, is that which philosophers call matter or corporeal substance."

**Key arguments:**

1. **The Master Argument:** It is impossible to conceive of something existing unconceived. The very attempt to imagine an unperceived tree involves perceiving it. Therefore, the notion of unperceived existence is self-contradictory.

2. **Likeness Principle:** An idea can only resemble another idea. If our ideas are supposed to represent material objects, how would we ever verify the resemblance? We only have access to our ideas.

3. **Abstraction Critique:** The concept of "matter" is an illicit abstraction—the idea of extension, figure, and motion without any sensible qualities is impossible to form.

4. **Empirical Grounds:** There are no empirical grounds for material substance. The doctrine that there is "unthinking stuff" which is the substance of things is an obvious contradiction: for how can an unthinking thing have ideas?

### Esse Est Percipi (To Be Is to Be Perceived)

For sensible things (objects of sense), existence consists in being perceived: *esse est percipi*. Berkeley also adds *vel percipere*—or to perceive. Spirits (minds) exist by perceiving; ideas exist by being perceived.

To say that something exists is to say that it is perceived by a perceiver. Since ideas exist only when they are perceived, if the mind did not exist to perceive them, the objects—or ideas—would not exist either.

**Important clarifications:**

- This applies to sensible things, not to minds
- Does not mean the world depends on human perception (God perceives always)
- Does not deny the reality of ordinary objects; it reinterprets their nature
- The perceivability of objects when not being perceived by finite minds is explained by their actually being perceived by an infinite mind (God)

### The Role of God

God is essential to Berkeley's system. According to Berkeley's immaterialist view, real things like desks, chairs, and books are just collections of ideas that exist in the mind of God. God sometimes exhibits these to us, and we experience them as sensations.

1. **Continuity of Objects:** When no finite mind perceives an object, God perceives it. Objects don't blink in and out of existence. A human (and thus a human mind) need not be present for the tree to make a sound, for the mind of God is always present.

2. **Source of Ideas:** The ideas we experience (the sensible world) are caused by God, not by material objects. There must be an incorporeal spirit responsible for the variation and existence of ideas, as material substances cannot be the cause.

3. **Laws of Nature:** The regularity and predictability of nature reflects God's consistent manner of producing ideas in finite minds.

4. **Existence of Other Minds:** We know other minds exist by analogy; we infer them from the ideas (bodies, behaviors) that God causes in us.

### Critique of Abstract Ideas

The mind cannot conceive abstract ideas. We cannot have an idea of some abstract thing that is common to many particular ideas and therefore has, at the same time, many different predicates and no predicates.

- We cannot form an idea of "triangle in general" that is neither equilateral, isosceles, nor scalene
- The mind cannot conceive of concepts like "color" or "man" in the abstract—when it thinks of "color" it thinks of a particular color
- Abstract ideas are impossible; we only have particular ideas
- General terms work by one particular idea standing for all similar particulars
- Many philosophical confusions stem from treating words as if they stood for abstract ideas

### Theory of Vision

In *An Essay towards a New Theory of Vision* (1709), Berkeley delved into the nature of visual perception, positioning himself within experimental psychology rather than traditional philosophy.

**Key arguments:**

1. **Rejecting Geometric Explanations:** Berkeley challenged the then-standard account of distance vision, which required tacit geometrical calculations. Descartes had claimed that an innate knowledge of geometry enables even those who have never studied geometry to calculate distance by figuring out the height of a triangle formed by light rays from the visible object to each eye.

2. **The Three Immediate Perceptions of Distance:**
   - The sensation we get when we cross our eyes to see something very close
   - The confused appearance of an object as it gets close to the eye
   - The muscular strain involved in preventing the confused appearance of an object close to the eye

3. **Association and Experience:** Our understanding of distance is rooted in immediate sensations and experiences, such as eye strain and the blurred appearance of nearby objects.

4. **Visual Objects as Mind-Dependent:** Berkeley argues that visual objects are in the mind, mind-dependent ideas.

5. **The Blind Person Thought Experiment:** A man blind from birth and newly given sight could not tell, visually, what objects were in front of him or how far away they were. He sees neither them nor the distance and has not had the experience which will permit him to infer what the visual signs signify.

6. **Visual ideas are a "language"** by which God informs us about the tactile world.

## Key Texts

### A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710)

The systematic exposition of immaterialism. Berkeley planned a multi-part work, but only Part I was published (Part II was lost during travels). Berkeley's goal in the Treatise is to argue against skepticism (philosophy of doubt) and atheism (the denial of the existence of God) to foster an awareness of God's presence and inspire greater piety.

**Key sections:**

- Introduction: Attack on abstract ideas
- Sections 1-33: Core arguments for immaterialism
- Sections 34-84: Responses to objections
- Sections 85-156: Implications and applications

**Three Kinds of Ideas:**
The three kinds of ideas are those of sensation, thought, and imagination. Ideas are known and perceived by a knowing perceiver. This active perceiver is designated by the names mind, spirit, soul, or self.

### Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous (1713)

A more accessible presentation of immaterialism in dialogue form, written as a response to the criticism Berkeley experienced after publishing the *Principles*.

- **Hylas** (Greek: "hyle" meaning "matter"): Defends materialism; represents the views of his opponents, particularly John Locke
- **Philonous** (Greek: "lover of mind"): Berkeley's spokesman

**Structure:**

- **First Dialogue:** Demonstrates that materialism—or the belief in the existence of mind-independent material objects—is incoherent, untenable, and leads ultimately to skepticism.

- **Second Dialogue:** Lays out Berkeley's alternative worldview, immaterialism, explaining that all that exists in the world are ideas and the minds that perceive them, including the infinite mind that contains all else, namely God.

- **Third Dialogue:** Fills in some details and defends immaterialism against possible objections; concludes with Hylas's conversion.

**Main Arguments:**

1. **The Argument Against Materialism:**
   (1) If we perceive mind-independent material objects, then we either perceive them immediately (through our senses) or mediately (by inferring them from what we immediately receive through our senses).
   (2) We do not immediately perceive mind-independent material objects.
   (3) We do not mediately perceive mind-independent material objects.
   (4) We have absolutely no reason to believe in the existence of mind-independent material objects.

2. **Arguments About Secondary Qualities:** Heat, taste, sound, smell, color have no existence outside sensations and perceptions in the minds of perceivers. Intense heat, like intense cold, is pain; it is intrinsically unpleasant. Pain, like pleasure, is a kind of experience; it is something that cannot exist outside someone's consciousness.

3. **Arguments About Primary Qualities:** Extension (length and width), shape, hardness, weight, motion also have no existence outside the perceptions of conscious beings. Every property that a sensible object has exists only as a sensation within a mind.

4. **The Perceptual Relativity Argument:** The same object can appear to have different characteristics depending on the observer's perspective. Since objective features cannot change without an inherent change in the object itself, shape must not be an objective feature.

### De Motu (1721)

Latin treatise on motion, critiquing Newton's concepts of absolute space and time. The essay was unsuccessfully submitted for a prize offered by the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris.

**Key Arguments Against Absolute Space:**

1. **The Thought Experiment:** Berkeley asks us to imagine all bodies in the universe being destroyed. Supposedly what remains is absolute space. But all its qualities (infinite, immovable, indivisible, insensible and without relation and distinction) are negative qualities. Absolute space is supposedly extended—but what kind of extension can neither be measured nor divided nor sensed nor even imagined? He concludes that absolute space is pure negation, a "mere nothing."

2. **Motion as Relative:** Motion and space are relative—they presuppose a relationship to some other body through which they are determined. If there were only one body in existence there could be no idea of motion, for motion is the change of position of two bodies relative to one another.

3. **Theological Motivation:** Berkeley found the view that absolute space necessarily exists, is uncreated, and cannot be annihilated, abhorrent—as it put absolute space in some respects on the level of God.

**Historical Significance:**
- Karl Popper considered Berkeley "the precursor of Mach and Einstein"
- Popper coined the term "Berkeley's razor" based on this work, similar to Occam's razor but "more powerful"
- Berkeley's arguments anticipated Ernst Mach's critique of Newtonian mechanics and Einstein's relativity

### Alciphron (1732)

Dialogue defending Christianity against "free-thinkers" and deists. Contains important discussions of:
- The meaning of religious language
- The analogy between divine and human attributes
- The social utility of religion

### Siris (1744)

Berkeley's last, strangest, and best-selling (in his own lifetime) philosophical work. *Siris* has a three-fold aim:
1. To establish the virtues of tar-water (a liquid prepared by letting pine tar stand in water) as a medical panacea
2. To provide scientific background supporting the efficacy of tar-water
3. To lead the mind of the reader, via gradual steps, toward contemplation of God

The work "passes by imperceptible stages from physical to metaphysical arguments, until he is fairly launched upon a general discussion of Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy." It develops a new Neoplatonic metaphysic of light and is written with compelling lucidity and charm.

T.T. Henn, writing of Yeats' reading of Berkeley, says there are "whole passages in this last curious disquisition that slides so easily between tar-water, Neo-platonism, chemistry and metaphysics."

## The Berkeley-Locke Relationship

Berkeley was deeply influenced by Locke but developed his philosophy largely through critique of Locke:

| Topic | Locke | Berkeley |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Abstract Ideas | Possible and necessary for knowledge | Impossible; source of confusion |
| Primary/Secondary Qualities | Primary are in objects; secondary in mind | Both are in the mind |
| Material Substance | Exists but unknowable | Does not exist at all |
| Ideas | Represent external objects | Are the only objects |
| God's Role | Creator of material world | Continuous perceiver; cause of ideas |

## Common Objections and Berkeley's Responses

### "If a tree falls in a forest with no one around, does it make a sound?"

**Berkeley's response:** The question assumes the tree could exist unperceived. But God always perceives. The tree, the forest, the sound all exist as ideas in God's mind. The scenario imagines the absence of finite perceivers, not of all perceivers.

### "This is obviously absurd—I can kick a stone to refute it" (Samuel Johnson)

**The Story:** After coming out of church, Boswell and Johnson stood talking of Bishop Berkeley's ingenious sophistry to prove the non-existence of matter. Boswell observed that though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true, it is impossible to refute it. Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it, saying "I refute it thus."

**Why This "Refutation" Fails:**
- Johnson's dismissal has named a type of fallacy: the *Argumentum ad lapidem* or "appeal to the stone"—dismissing an argument as absurd without proof of its absurdity
- Johnson's attempt is question-begging: He implies that kicking stones hurts because stones exist mind-independently, but since mind-independent existence is precisely what idealism denies, this does not refute idealism
- Berkeley never denied that stones are real or that we can interact with them—he denied only that stones are made of "matter" (an unperceiving substance)
- The hardness felt when kicking is an idea, and ideas are real
- Refuting Berkeley by kicking a stone is analogous to jumping up and down on flat ground to refute the curvature of the Earth

### "This makes the world depend on my mind—that's solipsism"

**Berkeley's response:** The world depends on mind, but not on *your* mind alone. God's infinite mind sustains all reality. The regularity and independence of nature from your will shows it comes from a greater mind than yours.

### "Science investigates matter and material causes"

**Berkeley's response:** Science investigates regularities in our experience—which ideas are conjoined with which other ideas. This project is untouched by immaterialism. "Matter" adds nothing explanatory. The real work is done by observed patterns and laws.

## Berkeley's Influence

### On David Hume

Hume radicalized Berkeley's critique of abstraction and extended skepticism about causation. Hume accepted Berkeley's criticism of abstract ideas, but he rejected the exception made by Berkeley of "notions."

According to Hume, all concepts must be obtained from sense data. Hume was the ultimate skeptic, convincingly reducing matter, mind, religion, and science to a matter of sense impressions and memories. He agreed with Bishop Berkeley that matter, or the existence of a world beyond our perceptions, is an unsupportable concept.

As Hegel noted: "If we subtract God from Berkeley, we get Hume."

### On Immanuel Kant

Berkeley's "thought made possible the work of Hume and thus Kant," as noted by Alfred North Whitehead. Ever since Kant said that Hume's discussion of causality had roused him from his "dogmatic slumbers" and compelled him to rethink his entire philosophy of the natural world, it has been usual to reckon Hume among the great—and thus Berkeley, who made Hume possible.

Kant responded to Berkeley by rejecting his immaterialism and replacing it with transcendental idealism, which views the mind-independent world as existent but incognizable in itself. Kant distinguished his position from Berkeley's "dogmatic idealism," claiming Berkeley denied the existence of outer objects while Kant only denied their independence from our forms of intuition.

Kant aptly christened Berkeley's idealism "mystic idealism," which claimed that nothing separated man and God, since nature or matter did not exist as a reality independent of consciousness.

### On Later Philosophy

- **Phenomenalism:** 19th and 20th-century philosophers (J.S. Mill, Russell, Ayer) developed phenomenalist positions inspired by Berkeley
- **Philosophy of Perception:** Berkeley's arguments about perception remain foundational
- **Philosophy of Science:** His critique of Newtonian absolute space anticipated later relational theories and instrumentalist interpretations of scientific theories
