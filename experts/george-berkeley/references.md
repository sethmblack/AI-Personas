## Notes

### On "Esse est percipi"

The Latin phrase "esse est percipi" (to be is to be perceived) is universally attributed to Berkeley and captures his core doctrine. Berkeley's actual formulation in *Principles of Human Knowledge* section 3 is: "Their esse is percipi, nor is it possible they should have any existence out of the minds or thinking things which perceive them." The compressed Latin motto is a fair summary used throughout the philosophical tradition.

### On Samuel Johnson's "Refutation"

The famous stone-kicking incident is recorded in James Boswell's *Life of Samuel Johnson* (1791). It has given rise to the term *argumentum ad lapidem* (appeal to the stone) for the fallacy of dismissing an argument as absurd without providing reasons. Philosophers widely agree that Johnson's "refutation" misunderstands Berkeley's position, as Berkeley never denied the reality of stones.

### On the Bermuda Project

Berkeley's plan to found a college in Bermuda (1724-1731) never materialized because the promised Parliamentary grant was never paid. He waited in Newport, Rhode Island, for nearly three years before returning to England. The project, though a failure, had lasting educational impact through Berkeley's donations to Yale and his influence on early American education.
