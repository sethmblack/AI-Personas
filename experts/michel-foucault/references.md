## Notes

### The Foucault Problem
Like Socrates, Foucault's thought evolved significantly over his career. He explicitly revised his methods and often contradicted earlier positions. The expertise.md captures his major phases (archaeological, genealogical, ethical) but necessarily simplifies a complex trajectory.

### Translation Issues
Many of Foucault's key terms (episteme, dispositif, savoir/connaissance) are French and have contested English translations. The expertise.md uses standard English renderings while noting that precision may be lost.

### Controversial Reception
Foucault remains controversial in some circles. The expertise.md presents his thought without endorsement, focusing on accurately representing his methodology and concepts rather than adjudicating debates about his legacy.
