## Key Works

### Madness and Civilization (1961)
French: *Folie et Deraison: Histoire de la folie a l'age classique*

Foucault's first major work examining the evolution of the meaning of madness in European cultures from the Middle Ages to the 18th century.

**Core arguments:**
- Madness is a social and cultural construct, not a natural category
- The "Great Confinement" of the 17th century incarcerated the "unreasonable" (mad, debtors, vagrants, dissenters)
- Psychiatry gained authority by defining what constitutes "madness"
- Modern psychiatric patients are bound by "invisible internalized chains"
- Power operates through discourse; the oppressed accept the oppressor's terms

**Historical significance:** Roy Porter called it "by far the most penetrating work ever written on the history of madness."

### The Order of Things (1966)
French: *Les Mots et les choses*

An "archaeology" of the human sciences examining how knowledge is organized in different historical periods.

**Core contributions:**
- Introduced the concept of the "episteme"
- Argued that historical periods are characterized by different epistemes
- Knowledge is not cumulative but subject to dramatic ruptures
- The "death of Man" thesis: the modern conception of "man" as subject is historically contingent

### The Archaeology of Knowledge (1969)
A methodological treatise formalizing the archaeological method.

**Core contributions:**
- Discursive formations are governed by rules beyond grammar and logic
- These rules operate beneath individual consciousness
- They define what can be thought and said in a given domain and period
- Analysis focuses on statements (enonces) and their conditions of possibility

### Discipline and Punish (1975)
French: *Surveiller et punir: Naissance de la prison*

Analysis of the transformation of Western penal systems and the birth of disciplinary society.

**Core contributions:**
- The panopticon as model of disciplinary power
- Shift from spectacular punishment to normalized discipline
- "The soul is the prison of the body"
- Power produces individuals; it does not simply repress them
- "Judges of normality are present everywhere"
- The Enlightenment "discovered the liberties" but "also invented the disciplines"

### The History of Sexuality, Volume 1 (1976)
French: *La Volonte de savoir*

Critique of the "repressive hypothesis" and introduction of biopolitics.

**Core contributions:**
- Refutation that Western society "repressed" sexuality
- Discourse on sexuality actually proliferated from the 17th century
- Confession as a technology of power (secularized from religious practice)
- Biopolitics: the state takes charge of life and the population
- "Where there is power, there is resistance"

### The History of Sexuality, Volumes 2-3 (1984)
*The Use of Pleasure* and *The Care of the Self*

Exploration of ancient Greek and Roman ethics and "technologies of the self."

**Core contributions:**
- Shift to ethics and self-constitution
- Technologies of the self: practices by which individuals transform themselves
- Ancient sexuality organized by active/passive distinction, not homosexual/heterosexual
- The examined life: how subjects constitute themselves as ethical beings

### College de France Lectures (1970-1984)

## Core Concepts

### Power/Knowledge (Pouvoir/Savoir)

Power and knowledge are inseparable. Power produces knowledge; knowledge enables power.

**Key formulations:**
- "There is no power relation without the correlative constitution of a field of knowledge"
- "Knowledge is not for knowing: knowledge is for cutting"
- Power is not something possessed but exercised
- Power is productive, not merely repressive
- Power operates through discourse, not just institutions

### The Panopticon

Jeremy Bentham's prison design as model for modern disciplinary society.

**Key features:**
- Visibility is a trap
- Permanent possibility of observation creates self-regulation
- Power without force: "fictitious relation" produces "real subjection"
- Laboratory of power: experiments in behavior modification
- Paradigm for schools, factories, hospitals, barracks

### Genealogy

Method derived from Nietzsche for tracing the historical emergence of concepts, practices, and institutions.

**Key principles:**
- Rejects metaphysical understanding of history
- Emphasizes contingency, not necessity
- Focuses on "descent" (Herkunft) and "emergence" (Entstehung)
- History of the body, not history of ideas
- Reveals "inglorious origins" of what seems natural or necessary
- "Truth is a thing of this world"

### Episteme

The underlying framework of knowledge that defines conditions of possibility for thought in a given era.

**Key features:**
- Historical a priori for what can be said and thought
- Defines boundaries of the thinkable
- Shifts dramatically between historical periods
- Not conscious to individual subjects
- Determines conceptual possibilities, not just content

### Discourse

Systems of representation that produce knowledge and meaning.

**Key features:**
- More than language: encompasses practices, institutions, power relations
- Determines what can be spoken, by whom, from what position
- Creates epistemic reality through fixing meaning
- Production of discourse is controlled in every society
- Discourse is "a violence we do to things"

### Biopolitics

The politics of life itself: government through administration of populations.

**Key features:**
- Emerged in 18th century with focus on "man-as-species"
- Concerned with birth rates, mortality, health, longevity
- "Make live and let die" (contrast with sovereign power: "make die and let live")
- Sexuality as nexus of biopolitics and discipline
- State racism as biopolitical mechanism

### Governmentality

The organized practices through which subjects are governed, including self-government.

**Key features:**
- "Conduct of conduct"
- Bridge between power over others and power over self
- Emerged from analysis of pastoral power (Christian care of souls)
- Neoliberal governmentality: homo economicus as entrepreneur of the self
- Connects disciplinary power to ethics and subjectivity

### Technologies of the Self

Practices by which individuals transform themselves.

**Key formulations:**
- Allow individuals to effect operations on "their own bodies, souls, thoughts, conduct"
- Goal: attain states of "happiness, purity, wisdom, perfection, or immortality"
- Ancient practices: journaling, meditation, examination of conscience
- Modern techniques: confession, therapy, self-help
- Connect ethics to politics through subjectivation

### Subjectivation (Assujettissement)

The double process of becoming a subject: subjected to power and constituted as a self.

**Key features:**
- Subjects are produced, not given
- Power shapes individuals into particular kinds of subjects
- The subject is not the foundation but the effect
- Self-constitution through ethical practices
- "The individual is a product of power"

## Famous Quotes

### On Power
- "Where there is power, there is resistance."
- "Power is not an institution, and not a structure; neither is it a certain strength we are endowed with; it is the name that one attributes to a complex strategical situation in a particular society."
- "The exercise of power perpetually creates knowledge and, conversely, knowledge constantly induces effects of power."

### On Discipline and the Body
- "The soul is the effect and instrument of a political anatomy; the soul is the prison of the body."
- "The 'Enlightenment', which discovered the liberties, also invented the disciplines."
- "Discipline 'makes' individuals; it is the specific technique of a power that regards individuals both as objects and as instruments of its exercise."

### On Normalization
- "The judges of normality are present everywhere. We are in the society of the teacher-judge, the doctor-judge, the educator-judge, the social worker-judge."
- "In its function, the power to punish is not essentially different from that of curing or educating."

### On Knowledge and Truth
- "Knowledge is not for knowing: knowledge is for cutting."
- "Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint."
- "Each society has its regime of truth."

### On the Subject
- "The individual, with his identity and characteristics, is the product of a relation of power exercised over bodies, multiplicities, movements, desires, forces."
- "Man is an invention of recent date. And one perhaps nearing its end."

### On Fascism
- "The strategic adversary is fascism... the fascism in us all, in our heads and in our everyday behavior, the fascism that causes us to love power, to desire the very thing that dominates and exploits us."

## Methodology

### Archaeological Analysis
- Examines discursive formations and their rules
- Focus on statements (enonces) and conditions of possibility
- Synchronic: maps knowledge structures within a period
- Discontinuity: identifies ruptures between epistemes
- "History of the present": understanding current conditions through their emergence

### Genealogical Analysis
- Traces historical emergence of practices and institutions
- Focus on power relations and the body
- Diachronic: follows contingent developments over time
- Nietzschean: skeptical of origins, attentive to power
- Critique of the present through showing it could be otherwise

### The Three Axes
Foucault's late work identified three interconnected axes of analysis:
1. **Knowledge (savoir):** What can be known and said
2. **Power (pouvoir):** Relations that shape and constrain
3. **Ethics (ethos):** Self-constitution and self-transformation

## Personal Life

### Death
Foucault died on June 25, 1984, from AIDS-related complications. He was among the first prominent public figures in France to die from the disease. His partner, Daniel Defert, founded the first major French AIDS organization (AIDES) in his memory.

### Writing and Intellectual Style
Foucault described himself as a "writer," not an "author"—committed to what exceeds language and discourse. His style combines:
- Dense theoretical analysis with historical detail
- Arresting formulations and memorable phrases
- Constant methodological self-revision
- Refusal of systematic philosophy
- Willingness to abandon earlier positions
