## Skill Candidates Identified

### 1. Genealogical Analysis

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear process: identify present concern, trace emergence, expose contingency, reveal power |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Obvious triggers: "How did this come to be?", "Why do we assume this is natural?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Single responsibility: tracing historical emergence of practices/concepts |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any concept, practice, or institution treated as natural |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Transforms understanding by revealing contingency; enables political imagination |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** A systematic method for tracing the historical emergence of concepts, practices, and institutions. Reveals that what appears natural, necessary, or rational has contingent origins in power, struggle, and accident. Follows Nietzsche in seeking "inglorious origins" rather than noble essences.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How did this come to be?"
- "Why is this considered natural?"
- "Trace the history of this practice"
- "When did we start doing this?"
- "What are the origins of this institution?"
- "How did this become normal?"

### 2. Discourse Analysis (Foucauldian)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Clear framework: identify statements, conditions of possibility, exclusions, subject positions |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Triggers: "What can be said about X?", "Analyze this discourse", "What is unsayable?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on discursive formations and their rules |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any domain of knowledge, expertise, or field of statements |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Reveals hidden constraints on thought; exposes power in language |

**Total: 49/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Examines not what is said but what makes statements possible. Identifies the rules governing what can be thought and said within a domain, who can speak with authority, from what positions, and what is systematically excluded. Treats discourse as productive, not merely descriptive.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What makes this sayable?"
- "Analyze this discourse"
- "What assumptions underlie this field?"
- "Who can speak here?"
- "What cannot be said in this framework?"
- "What are the rules of this discourse?"

---

### 3. Power Mapping

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Framework: identify actors, trace relations, find capillary operations, map resistance |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Triggers: "Where is power here?", "How does power operate?", "Analyze the power relations" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on mapping power in specific situations |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any institution, practice, or social arrangement |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Makes visible what is often invisible; enables strategic intervention |

**Total: 49/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Maps how power circulates in a given situation, institution, or practice. Power is not held but exercised; not repressive but productive. Analysis traces power from the micro-level (bodies, gestures, spatial arrangements) upward, identifying what power produces, how resistance operates, and how knowledge and power intertwine.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Where is power operating here?"
- "How is power exercised in this situation?"
- "Map the power relations"
- "What does this arrangement produce?"
- "Where is resistance possible?"
- "How does this institution work on bodies?"

### 4. Problematization

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Process: identify the "problem", ask how it became one, trace its constitution |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Triggers: "How did this become a problem?", "Why is this an issue?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on questioning the constitution of problems |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies whenever something is treated as obviously requiring intervention |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Disrupts assumption that problems are natural; opens new possibilities |

**Total: 49/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Asks not what something is, but how it became a "problem" requiring attention, intervention, or management. Questions the constitution of objects of concern. Reveals that what seems to demand solution is itself a historical construction that shapes what solutions are thinkable.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How did this become a problem?"
- "Why is this seen as an issue?"
- "Who made this a concern?"
- "When did we start worrying about this?"
- "What does treating this as a problem enable?"
- "Could this be thought differently?"

### 5. Normalization Critique

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Framework clear but requires careful judgment |
| Invocable | 9/10 | Triggers: "What norm is operating here?", "How is normality enforced?" |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on norms and normalization |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any domain with norms: education, medicine, law, workplace |
| Valuable | 9/10 | Exposes how normalization creates conformity and deviance |

**Total: 45/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** Identifies how norms operate to produce conformity and mark deviance. Examines how individuals are ranked, classified, and judged against standards that appear neutral but are historically produced. Exposes "the judges of normality" in various domains.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What norm is operating here?"
- "How is normality being defined?"
- "What makes someone deviant?"
- "Who are the judges of normality?"
- "How does this ranking work?"

---

### 6. Panoptic Analysis

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Clear model: visibility, self-regulation, continuous surveillance |
| Invocable | 8/10 | Triggers: "Is this panoptic?", "How does surveillance operate?" |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on surveillance and visibility regimes |
| Reusable | 9/10 | Applies to many modern institutions and technologies |
| Valuable | 8/10 | Powerful metaphor but overlaps with power-mapping |

**Total: 42/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** Applies the panopticon model to analyze surveillance regimes. Examines how visibility produces self-regulation, how the possibility of being watched creates docile subjects, and how modern institutions extend panoptic logic.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Is this panoptic?"
- "How does surveillance work here?"
- "How does visibility produce behavior?"
- "What is the logic of observation?"

### 7. Biopolitical Analysis

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 7/10 | Framework exists but more complex |
| Invocable | 8/10 | Triggers: "How is life being managed?", "Is this biopolitical?" |
| Scoped | 8/10 | Focused on governance of populations and life |
| Reusable | 8/10 | Applies to health, demographics, sexuality, security |
| Valuable | 8/10 | Important but more specialized |

**Total: 39/50** | **Priority: LOW**

**Description:** Examines how power operates at the level of populations rather than individuals. Focuses on "making live and letting die"—the management of birth, death, health, and life through statistics, policies, and interventions.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How is life being managed here?"
- "Is this biopolitical?"
- "How does population enter the calculation?"
- "What is the politics of life?"

## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority):**
1. `genealogical-analysis` - Tracing historical emergence and contingency
2. `discourse-analysis` - Examining what can be said and thought
3. `power-mapping` - Identifying how power circulates
4. `problematization` - Questioning how issues become "problems"

**Phase 2 - Extended Skills (MEDIUM Priority):**
5. `normalization-critique` - If needed for specific applications
6. `panoptic-analysis` - If surveillance is a frequent topic

**Not Recommended:**
- Biopolitical Analysis (too specialized; can be covered within genealogical or power-mapping)

---

## Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Added to `experts/michel-foucault/PROMPT.md` in an "Available Skills" section
2. Triggered proactively when the Foucault expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly

### Skill Interaction Notes

- **problematization** + **genealogical-analysis**: Natural pairing—problematize first, then trace genealogy
- **discourse-analysis** + **power-mapping**: Use together to analyze expertise and institutional knowledge
- **genealogical-analysis** + **power-mapping**: Combine for historical analysis of institutions
- **problematization** + **discourse-analysis**: Use when questioning how a domain of knowledge emerged

### Key Implementation Principle

All Foucauldian skills should maintain the **questioning stance**—never affirming what is given, always asking how it came to be, what power relations sustain it, and what it renders unthinkable. The output should make the familiar strange and open possibilities for thinking otherwise.
