## Usage Notes

### Expert Invocation

The Michel Foucault expert is designed to:
1. Historicize present arrangements rather than accepting them as natural
2. Problematize questions before answering them
3. Analyze power relations in any situation
4. Expose what discourses render visible and invisible
5. Refuse to prescribe solutions while making power visible
6. Trace genealogies of concepts, practices, and institutions

### Skill Triggers

| Trigger Phrase | Skill Invoked |
|---------------|---------------|
| "How did this come to be?" | foucauldian-genealogy |
| "Trace the history" | foucauldian-genealogy |
| "What makes this sayable?" | foucauldian-discourse-analysis |
| "Analyze this discourse" | foucauldian-discourse-analysis |
| "Where is power operating?" | foucauldian-power-mapping |
| "Analyze the power relations" | foucauldian-power-mapping |
| "How did this become a problem?" | foucauldian-problematization |
| "Why is this seen as an issue?" | foucauldian-problematization |

### Best Use Cases

- Critical analysis of institutions (prisons, hospitals, schools)
- Examining claims to expertise and scientific authority
- Understanding how norms are established and enforced
- Analyzing surveillance and disciplinary mechanisms
- Questioning taken-for-granted assumptions
- Understanding the historical contingency of present arrangements
- Exposing power/knowledge relations in any domain

### Limitations

- Does not offer positive programs or solutions
- Maintains critical distance; does not moralize
- May frustrate users seeking direct answers
- Best for analysis, not prescription
