## HIGH Priority

### 1. creative-destruction-audit

**Source Pattern:** Creative Destruction / "Every act of creation is first an act of destruction"
**Purpose:** Identify what must be destroyed—old assumptions, comfortable techniques, previous successes—before new creation can emerge.
**Trigger:** "What should I destroy to create?" or "I'm stuck and need to break through" or "Creative destruction audit"
**Inputs:** Current creative situation, existing work/approach, desired direction (if any), what feels stuck or stale
**Outputs:** List of specific things to destroy (habits, assumptions, techniques, previous successes), why each is blocking progress, concrete destruction actions, what space opens after destruction
**Reasoning:** This is Picasso's core creative philosophy. Clear 4-step process: identify what's stale, diagnose why it blocks, prescribe destruction, envision the opening. Applicable to any creative field. Addresses the common problem of incremental improvement when radical change is needed.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific identification and destruction steps
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger when stuck or stale
- Scoped: YES - one responsibility (identifying and clearing creative blocks)
- Reusable: YES - applies to art, writing, business, product design
- Valuable: YES - addresses universal creative stagnation problem

**Score: 45/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 2. steal-like-an-artist

**Source Pattern:** "Good artists copy. Great artists steal" / The stealing process
**Purpose:** Transform the practice of learning from influences into true creative theft—absorbing and transforming rather than copying.
**Trigger:** "How do I learn from X without copying?" or "Steal like an artist" or "I'm worried about being derivative"
**Inputs:** Influences to learn from, what aspects to absorb, target medium/domain, current creative voice
**Outputs:** Stealing strategy (what to take, what to leave), transformation plan (how to make it unrecognizable), combination approach (mixing multiple sources), integration method (absorbing into existing voice)
**Reasoning:** Addresses the universal anxiety about originality and influence. Picasso's distinction between copying and stealing is precise and actionable. 4-step process clearly defined. Liberates creators from paralysis around influence.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - explicit process for absorbing and transforming
- Invocable: YES - "steal like an artist" is memorable trigger
- Scoped: YES - focused on influence absorption
- Reusable: YES - applies to any creative domain
- Valuable: YES - solves originality anxiety

**Score: 47/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 3. prolific-output-system

**Source Pattern:** Prolific Output as Method / "Inspiration exists, but it has to find you working"
**Purpose:** Design a sustainable system for massive creative output, based on Picasso's 12+ hour daily practice and 50,000-work lifetime.
**Trigger:** "How do I produce more?" or "Set up a prolific output system" or "I want to be more productive creatively"
**Inputs:** Current output rate, time available, creative domain, blocking factors, perfectionism level
**Outputs:** Daily schedule design, quantity targets (not quality), process for accepting mediocrity, system for continuous work, metrics for tracking volume
**Reasoning:** Picasso's most practically applicable principle. Clear framework: work every day, prioritize quantity, accept failures, trust emergence. Addresses perfectionism and procrastination. Transforms creative practice from occasional inspiration to daily discipline.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific schedule and system design
- Invocable: YES - triggered by productivity desires
- Scoped: YES - focused on output volume
- Reusable: YES - any creative domain
- Valuable: YES - solves chronic underproduction

**Score: 44/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 4. mastery-to-innocence

**Source Pattern:** "It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child"
**Purpose:** Guide the journey from technical mastery through systematic unlearning toward recovered innocence and spontaneity.
**Trigger:** "How do I unlearn?" or "I've mastered the rules—now what?" or "Mastery to innocence" or "I've lost my spontaneity"
**Inputs:** Area of mastery, learned rules and conventions, what feels stiff or formulaic, desired quality of spontaneity
**Outputs:** Inventory of learned rules to examine, unlearning exercises, methods to recover child's eye, balance between skill and spontaneity
**Reasoning:** Addresses the paradox faced by skilled practitioners—technical mastery can kill creativity. Picasso's framework: master completely, then systematically unlearn. 3-stage process. Relevant to any field where expertise creates rigidity.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific unlearning exercises and methods
- Invocable: YES - triggered by feeling of lost spontaneity
- Scoped: YES - focused on transcending mastery
- Reusable: YES - applies to any skilled domain
- Valuable: YES - solves expert's curse

**Score: 42/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 5. reinvention-protocol

**Source Pattern:** The Perpetual Reinvention / Style as Prison
**Purpose:** Systematically reinvent creative practice when current approach has become comfortable, successful, or recognized—before stagnation sets in.
**Trigger:** "I need to reinvent myself" or "My work has become formulaic" or "Reinvention protocol" or "I'm too comfortable"
**Inputs:** Current successful approach, what feels easy or automatic, market/audience expectations, what you fear or avoid
**Outputs:** Comfort diagnosis, direction for reinvention (often toward what you fear), transition plan, methods for killing previous identity
**Reasoning:** Picasso reinvented himself 6+ times across distinct periods. Clear pattern: comfort is the warning sign, fear points the direction, destruction enables renewal. Addresses the trap of success and market pressure for consistency.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific reinvention direction and plan
- Invocable: YES - triggered by comfort or staleness
- Scoped: YES - focused on creative reinvention
- Reusable: YES - any creative or professional domain
- Valuable: YES - prevents stagnation after success

**Score: 43/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 6. truth-through-distortion

**Source Pattern:** Art as Lie That Reveals Truth / "I paint objects as I think them, not as I see them"
**Purpose:** Apply deliberate distortion, exaggeration, or abstraction to reveal deeper truth about a subject.
**Trigger:** "How do I make this more true?" or "Truth through distortion" or "What's the essence here?"
**Inputs:** Subject to represent, literal/surface truth, deeper truth to reveal, medium for expression
**Outputs:** Identification of essential features, distortion strategy (what to exaggerate, what to eliminate), test for whether distortion serves truth
**Reasoning:** Core to Picasso's approach but more abstract than other skills. "Art is the elimination of the unnecessary" provides clear method. Applicable to visual art, writing, presentation design, communication. Medium priority because less universally applicable than destruction/stealing/output.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - identification and distortion steps
- Invocable: YES - triggered by representation challenges
- Scoped: YES - focused on essential truth
- Reusable: PARTIAL - strongest in visual/narrative domains
- Valuable: YES - transforms communication

**Score: 38/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

### 7. creative-diary-practice

**Source Pattern:** The Diary of Being / "Painting is just another way of keeping a diary"
**Purpose:** Integrate creative practice with daily life as a form of continuous documentation and expression.
**Trigger:** "How do I make art part of my life?" or "Creative diary practice"
**Inputs:** Life circumstances, available time, creative medium, what wants expression
**Outputs:** Daily practice structure, connection between life events and creative work, method for capturing and transforming experience
**Reasoning:** Picasso's fusion of life and art. Less structured than other skills but addresses important question of sustainable creative practice. Medium priority because more personal/lifestyle-oriented than technique-oriented.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - daily practice structure
- Invocable: YES - triggered by life/art integration desire
- Scoped: YES - focused on daily practice
- Reusable: YES - any creative medium
- Valuable: PARTIAL - more lifestyle than technique

**Score: 35/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**
