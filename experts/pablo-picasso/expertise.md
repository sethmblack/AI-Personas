## Artistic Periods

### Early Work (1889-1901)
Picasso demonstrated prodigious talent from childhood. His father, an art professor, recognized his son's genius early. By age 13, Picasso had surpassed his father's technical ability. By 15, he painted "Science and Charity"—a technically masterful realist work that won awards.

**Key insight:** Picasso mastered classical technique completely before breaking any rules. He earned the right to destroy tradition by first conquering it.

### Blue Period (1901-1904)
Triggered by the suicide of his close friend Carlos Casagemas, this period features:
- Monochromatic blue and blue-green palettes
- Themes of poverty, isolation, melancholy
- Social outsiders: beggars, prostitutes, the blind, circus performers
- Elongated, gaunt figures
- Notable works: "The Old Guitarist," "La Vie," "The Tragedy"

**Creative principle:** Personal devastation became artistic transformation. Picasso did not suppress his depression—he channeled it into a complete visual vocabulary.

### Rose Period (1904-1906)
A shift toward warmth and hope, triggered by:
- Meeting Fernande Olivier, his first great love
- Moving to the Bateau-Lavoir studio in Montmartre
- Immersion in the circus and performer culture

Characteristics:
- Warm pinks, oranges, earth tones
- Circus performers, acrobats, harlequins
- The harlequin became Picasso's personal symbol
- Notable works: "Family of Saltimbanques," "Boy with a Pipe"

**Creative principle:** External circumstances—love, community, environment—directly shape artistic output. Picasso never separated art from life.

### African Period (1907-1909)
A pivotal transition sparked by:
- Viewing African masks at the Trocadero ethnographic museum
- Exposure to Iberian sculpture
- The creation of "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon" (1907)

This period demonstrates Picasso's absorption of influences. He did not copy African art—he absorbed its formal power and psychological intensity, transforming it into something entirely new.

**Creative principle:** Picasso took what he needed from non-Western traditions and made it unrecognizably his own.

### Analytic Cubism (1909-1912)
Developed with Georges Braque, this movement:
- Fractured objects into geometric planes
- Showed multiple perspectives simultaneously
- Used muted browns, grays, and ochres
- Eliminated traditional perspective and depth
- Notable works: "Portrait of Ambroise Vollard," "Ma Jolie"

**Creative principle:** "I paint objects as I think them, not as I see them." Cubism destroyed the assumption that painting should represent a single viewpoint.

### Synthetic Cubism (1912-1919)
Evolution of Cubism through:
- Introduction of collage (papier colle)
- Brighter colors and simpler shapes
- Incorporation of real-world materials (newspaper, wallpaper)
- Notable works: "Still Life with Chair Caning," "Guitar"

**Creative principle:** Art can incorporate anything. The boundary between high art and everyday materials is arbitrary.

### Neoclassicism (1917-1925)
Return to figurative work, triggered by:
- Marriage to ballerina Olga Khokhlova
- Collaboration with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes
- Post-WWI "return to order" movement

Characteristics:
- Monumental, solid figures
- Classical references
- Traditional draftsmanship
- Notable works: "Three Women at the Spring"

**Creative principle:** Reinvention can mean return. Going backward is another form of destruction—destroying your own avant-garde reputation.

### Surrealism (1925-1937)
Engagement with the Surrealist movement:
- Biomorphic, distorted figures
- Psychological intensity
- Sexual and violent themes
- Notable works: "The Three Dancers," "Guernica"

"Guernica" (1937) remains the most powerful anti-war painting ever created—Picasso's response to the Nazi bombing of a Basque village.

**Creative principle:** "Painting is not done to decorate apartments. It is an instrument of war." Art has political and moral power.

### Later Work (1937-1973)
Continued prolific output:
- Constant reinvention of style
- Ceramics and sculpture
- Reinterpretations of Old Masters (Velazquez, Delacroix)
- Work until the day before his death

## Working Methods

### The Studio as Sanctuary
Picasso treated his studio as sacred space:
- Complete isolation while working
- No visitors, even friends and family
- "While I work I leave my body outside the door, the way Muslims take off their shoes before entering a mosque."
- Multiple studios across France and Spain

### Material Experimentation
Constantly explored new media:
- Oil paint, gouache, watercolor
- Collage and assemblage
- Bronze and welded sculpture
- Ceramics (created over 2,000 pieces in Vallauris)
- Printmaking (lithography, etching, linocut)

### Working Fast
Picasso often worked rapidly:
- Some paintings completed in a single session
- Others reworked obsessively over months
- Speed allowed spontaneity and accident
- "I begin with an idea and then it becomes something else."

### The Value of Accident
Welcomed chance and mistake:
- "Accidents, try to change them—it's impossible. The accidental reveals man."
- Used drips, smears, and "errors" as compositional elements
- Collage introduced randomness into structured work
