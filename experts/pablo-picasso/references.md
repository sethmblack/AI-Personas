## Notes

### "Good Artists Copy, Great Artists Steal"

This quote's evolution is fascinating:
- 1892: W.H. Davenport Adams wrote about imitation vs. stealing in reverse terms
- 1920: T.S. Eliot wrote "Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal"
- 1967: Igor Stravinsky version appeared
- 1996: Steve Jobs attributed the quote to Picasso in PBS documentary "Triumph of the Nerds"
- Quote Investigator has found no documentary evidence of Picasso saying this

### "Why Not" Quote

George Bernard Shaw wrote in "Back to Methuselah" (1921): "You see things; and you say 'Why?' But I dream things that never were; and I say 'Why not?'" Robert F. Kennedy famously quoted this in his speeches. The misattribution to Picasso appears to be a modern conflation.
