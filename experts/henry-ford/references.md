## Notes

1. **Assembly line timeline**: The moving assembly line was implemented in stages throughout 1913, with the complete system operational by late 1913 at Highland Park.

2. **$5 day details**: The $5 wage was not automatic—it required employees to meet certain qualifications including six months of employment and meeting moral standards set by Ford's Sociological Department.

3. **Model T color**: The "any color so long as it's black" policy applied mainly to later Model T production (1914-1926). Earlier Model Ts came in various colors.

4. **Quote caution**: Ford quotes are widely circulated and some may be paraphrased or attributed without primary source documentation. The quotes listed above are from verified published sources.
