## HIGH Priority

### 1. assembly-line-process-design

**Source Pattern:** The Assembly Line Model / Ford Production System
**Purpose:** Transform complex workflows into simple, repeatable, scalable production processes by breaking work into discrete steps.
**Trigger:** "Optimize this workflow" or "Make this process scalable" or "Reduce cycle time" or "Design a production process"
**Inputs:** Current workflow description; cycle time if known; handoffs and wait points; complexity pain points.
**Outputs:** Simplified process design; step-by-step breakdown; standardization recommendations; cycle time projections.
**Reasoning:** Direct application of Ford's assembly line principles; actionable 6-step framework in expertise; high reuse potential for any process design challenge.

### 2. simplification-audit

**Source Pattern:** The Simplification Imperative
**Purpose:** Systematically identify and eliminate unnecessary complexity, options, and variations from systems, processes, or products.
**Trigger:** "Simplify this" or "Too many options" or "This is too complicated" or "What's the Model T version?"
**Inputs:** System/process/product to simplify; current options and variations; stated reasons for complexity.
**Outputs:** Complexity inventory; elimination recommendations; standardization targets; "Model T version" specification.
**Reasoning:** Ford's "any color so long as it's black" philosophy applied systematically; clear actionable framework; high reuse for technical simplification.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 3. worker-investment-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The $5 Day Philosophy
**Purpose:** Analyze worker/team investment decisions through the lens of strategic value creation rather than cost minimization.
**Trigger:** "Are we paying enough?" or "Should we invest in developer experience?" or "Evaluate team compensation" or "Turnover analysis"
**Inputs:** Current compensation/investment levels; turnover rates; training costs; productivity metrics.
**Outputs:** Investment analysis; turnover cost calculation; strategic value assessment; recommended investment levels.
**Reasoning:** Based on Ford's counterintuitive $5 day; applicable to modern developer experience and compensation decisions; less frequent trigger than process skills.

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Vertical Integration | Already covered by john-d-rockefeller's vertical-integration-assessment |
| Learning by Doing | Philosophy/mindset, not actionable workflow |
| Biographical Timeline | Pure reference data, no workflow |
| Quotable Wisdom | Reference material for voice, not invocable process |
| Stories and Anecdotes | Teaching examples, not standalone processes |
