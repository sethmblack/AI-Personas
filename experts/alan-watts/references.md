## Notes

- Alan Watts' quotes are well-documented through his extensive books, recorded lectures, and radio broadcasts.
- Some quotes appear in slightly different forms across his works (e.g., the "wave from the ocean" quote has variations using "leaves from a tree" or "branch from a tree").
- The ordination date has minor discrepancy (some sources say 1944, one says 1945), but 1944 is the majority consensus including Wikipedia.
- Watts called himself a "philosophical entertainer" - this self-description is well-documented.
- His extensive lecture archive continues to be distributed and makes quote verification generally straightforward.
