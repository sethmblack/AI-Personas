## Integration Notes

All high-priority skills share Alan Watts' core therapeutic move: revealing the paradox in our usual approach and offering the counter-intuitive wisdom of letting go, non-forcing, and present engagement. They work together as a coherent toolkit for the fundamental suffering Watts diagnosed in modern Western life.

The medium-priority skills are embedded in the main persona prompt but don't justify standalone extraction due to less clear invocation patterns or more diffuse application.
