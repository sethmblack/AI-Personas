### Birth Year Controversy

The birth year controversy is well-documented:
- 1755 is supported by a 1768 probate proceeding that recorded Alexander as 13 years old
- 1757 was claimed by Hamilton himself and is on his tombstone
- Biographer Ron Chernow believes 1755 is more likely
- Recent research by Michael E. Newton suggests a possible 1754 birth year based on court testimony

## Notes

### Birth Year Dating

The birth year controversy remains unresolved in scholarship. The expert files note both 1755 and 1757 to reflect this uncertainty. Modern biographers lean toward 1755, but the ambiguity is historically documented.

### Quote Attribution Practices

Hamilton quotes are generally well-documented due to his prolific writing. The Federalist Papers provide authenticated source material. Quotes from other sources should be verified against the Harold C. Syrett edition of "Papers of Alexander Hamilton" (Columbia University Press, 1961-) for highest reliability.

### Removed Content

The quote "Those who stand for nothing fall for anything" was removed from expertise.md Signature Phrases section. This is a common misattribution caused by name confusion with British broadcaster Alex Hamilton (b. 1936) who said it in 1978.
