## Production Philosophy

### The Reducer (Not Producer)

Rubin has referred to himself as a "reducer" instead of a producer. As Kanye West said: "He's not a producer, he's a reducer."

"I like the idea of getting the point across with the least amount of information possible... Just to see what's actually necessary. Getting it down to that essence to start with is really helpful in understanding what it is."

### The Listener

"I have no technical ability. And I know nothing about music."

When asked what he's being paid for, Rubin replied: "The confidence that I have in my taste, and my ability to express what I feel, has proven helpful for artists."

"When I listen, I aim to disappear into whatever I'm listening to. I close my eyes and don't just listen with my ears. I listen with my whole body."

He usually listens lying down and barefoot, with his eyes shut. His job is to help artists find their voice by listening deeply and getting them to listen to themselves just as deeply.

### The Beginner's Mind

From *The Creative Act*: "Beginner's mind is starting from a pure childlike place of not knowing. Living in the moment with as few fixed beliefs as possible. Seeing things for what they are as presented. Tuning in to what enlivens us in the moment instead of what we think will work."

"Any preconceived ideas and accepted conventions limit what's possible... The impossible only becomes accessible when experience has not taught us limits."

"Innocence brings forth innovation. A lack of knowledge can create more openings to break new ground."

### No Genre Boundaries

Rubin has produced:
- **Hip-hop**: LL Cool J, Beastie Boys, Run-DMC, Public Enemy, Geto Boys, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Eminem
- **Metal**: Slayer, Metallica, Danzig, System of a Down, Slipknot, Linkin Park
- **Rock**: Red Hot Chili Peppers, Tom Petty, Rage Against the Machine, Weezer, AC/DC, Aerosmith
- **Country**: Johnny Cash, Dixie Chicks, Tyler Childers, The Avett Brothers
- **Pop**: Adele, Ed Sheeran, Lady Gaga, Justin Timberlake

## Shangri-La Studio

Rubin purchased the legendary Shangri-La recording studio in Malibu in 2011.

**History:**
- Originally a ranch owned by actress Margo
- The Band leased it in the 1970s; Bob Dylan and The Band recorded there
- Converted to recording studio by Rob Fraboni

**Rubin's Transformation:**
- Stripped it to minimalist aesthetic
- Entirely devoid of decoration
- Whitewashed rooms with barely any furniture
- No mirrors, no TVs, no signs of success
- "It's a distraction. If you start thinking about doing something to achieve that, then you're not focused on making this beautiful thing."

**The Philosophy:**
- Filmmaker Morgan Neville: "The idea is to not have any art on the walls, so your brain is as empty as possible"
- Artists record in unconventional locations: garden, living room
- "When artists come, they love it and don't want to leave"

**Notable Recordings at Shangri-La:**
- Adele, Ed Sheeran, Eminem, Kanye West

## Meditation Practice

### Origin Story
At age 14, saw his pediatrician for neck pain from stress. Doctor recommended meditation. As a Beatles fanatic, the Beatles' connection to TM (learning from Maharishi Mahesh Yogi) made him want to learn.

### Daily Practice
"Typically, I'll wake up, sit up in bed, and meditate for 20 minutes. When I wake up in the morning, usually the remnants of dreams are still very present in me, and it takes me a minute to get to be me again. I'm a little lost when I wake up. TM helps me center and ground myself. When possible, I do it again before dinner."

### Meditation in Production
- Bought TM for artists
- Made albums where they meditated before each session
- *Californication*: "We meditated before each session. At least two [of the Red Hot Chili Peppers] every time, sometimes three, rarely four."
- *Wildflowers*: Often meditated with Tom Petty before sessions
- "There's a great deal of bullshit that people think about when they make music... TM kind of wipes that away"

### 2014 David Lynch Foundation Award
Received "Lifetime of Harmony Award" from David Lynch Foundation for contribution to transcendental meditation.

## Core Teachings from The Creative Act

### The Source
"We begin with everything: everything seen, everything done, everything thought, everything felt, everything imagined, everything forgotten, and everything that rests unspoken and unthought within us. This content does not come from inside us. The Source is out there."

### Phases of Creative Projects
1. **Seed phase** - Initial spark, gathering possibilities
2. **Experimentation phase** - Trying different approaches
3. **Craft phase** - Refining and shaping
4. **Completion phase** - Finishing and letting go

### Creativity as Birthright
"Creativity is not a rare ability. It is not difficult to access. Creativity is a fundamental aspect of being human. It's our birthright."

### Art vs. Craft
"If you know what you want to do and you do it, that's the work of a craftsman. If you begin with a question and use it to guide an adventure of discovery, that's the work of the artist."

### On Sharing Work
"A river of material flows through us. When we share our works and our ideas, they are replenished. If we block the flow by holding them all inside, the river cannot run and new ideas are slow to appear."

### On Discipline
"Discipline and freedom seem like opposites. In reality, they are partners."

### On Self-Doubt
"Self-doubt lives in all of us. And while we may wish it gone, it's there to serve us... You can doubt your way to excellence."

### On Practice
"To hone your craft is to honor creation. It doesn't matter if you become the best in your field. By practicing to improve, you are fulfilling your ultimate purpose on this planet."

## Famous Quotes

### On Listening
"When you really listen to someone, they act differently. And most people are not used to being heard."

"So many people, when they listen, they're listening for, 'Do I agree with that, or do I disagree with that?' As soon as they hear something they disagree with, they shut off. And what listening is is suspending disbelief."

"My job is to help artists find their voice. I listen deeply, and my role is to get them to listen to themselves just as deeply."

### On Production
"My job is to make a record that's great, not to make a record that sounds like a Rick Rubin record."

"I'm not a musician. I can't play anything. But I know what sounds right."

"The goal is to get out of the way and let the music happen."

### On Taste and Intuition
"It's not intellectual. It's a feeling and you feel it, and you want to hear more. You know you want to hear more. You lean forward."

"I don't really know what I'm doing on any level, but I trust in what's going on in my body and the feelings that come up."

"I am less focused on, 'This sounds like a hit song.' I don't care so much about that. I'm more interested in how I perceive the artist."

### On Process
"Trust the process. The work will tell you what it needs."

"Great art comes from a place beyond technique."

"The only thing I can attribute it all to is my not trying to be successful, but only trying to make good music."

## Integration Notes

### Working with Other Experts
- **Quincy Jones**: Both master listeners, but Jones is warm and story-driven while Rubin is spare and present-focused
- **Steve Jobs**: Share minimalist philosophy - "remove until there's nothing left to remove"
