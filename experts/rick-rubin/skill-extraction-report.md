## HIGH Priority

### 1. essential-reduction

**Source Pattern:** The Rubin Method - Reduce Relentlessly / The Reducer (Not Producer)
**Purpose:** Apply subtractive analysis to creative work, identifying what can be removed to strengthen the core essence
**Trigger:** "What can I remove from this?", "Strip this to essentials", "Apply reduction", "Make this more minimal"
**Inputs:** Creative work to analyze (code, design, writing, music, system), context about purpose and constraints
**Outputs:** Prioritized list of elements that can be removed, justification for each removal, assessment of impact on essential function
**Reasoning:** Clear repeatable methodology: identify core purpose, evaluate each element against purpose, remove anything that doesn't directly serve. This is Rubin's signature approach (used with Yeezus, Johnny Cash, Slayer). Applicable across all creative domains. Saves significant time by providing structured framework for simplification decisions. High frequency pattern with 6+ explicit steps in expertise.md.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear 5-step process (identify purpose, evaluate elements, test removal, assess impact, iterate)
- Invocable: YES - Trigger phrases like "reduce this", "strip to essentials"
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility: evaluate and recommend removals
- Reusable: YES - Applies to code, writing, design, music, systems, process
- Valuable: YES - Saves 30+ minutes of unfocused editing, ensures principled decisions

### 2. deep-listening-session

**Source Pattern:** The Rubin Method - Listen Deeply / The Listener
**Purpose:** Conduct a deep listening session to understand what creative work wants to become, suspending judgment and preconception
**Trigger:** "Listen to this deeply", "What does this want to become?", "Help me hear what's really there"
**Inputs:** Creative work to analyze, artist/creator intent (optional), context about the project
**Outputs:** Report of what was heard (not evaluated), questions the work raises, observations about what the work seems to want, potential directions suggested by the work itself
**Reasoning:** Rubin's listening methodology is explicit: listen with whole body, suspend disbelief, close eyes (metaphorically focus attention), note what makes you "lean forward." This transforms evaluation from judgment to discovery. Used constantly in his production work. High value for anyone stuck in their own perspective on creative work.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear process: prepare attention, receive without judgment, note responses, report observations
- Invocable: YES - "Listen to this", "What does this want?"
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility: deep receptive analysis
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any creative work across domains
- Valuable: YES - Unlocks perspectives the creator cannot access alone

### 3. better-vs-different-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Making It Great vs. Making It Different
**Purpose:** Evaluate proposed changes to creative work to distinguish lateral moves (different but not better) from genuine improvements
**Trigger:** "Is this change better or just different?", "Evaluate this revision", "Should I make this change?"
**Inputs:** Original version, proposed change/revision, context about goals
**Outputs:** Assessment categorizing change as Better (improves toward purpose), Different (lateral move), Worse (detracts from purpose), with reasoning and recommendation
**Reasoning:** This is a critical gate in any creative process. Most changes are lateral - different but not better. Rubin explicitly identified this as a key technique. Clear binary output with reasoning. Saves wasted effort on unnecessary revisions. Applicable to code refactoring, design iterations, writing edits.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear evaluation framework with defined categories
- Invocable: YES - "Is this better or just different?"
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility: evaluate one change
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any revision in any domain
- Valuable: YES - Prevents wasted effort, builds revision discipline

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. sacred-space-design

**Source Pattern:** The Rubin Method - Create Sacred Space / Shangri-La Studio philosophy
**Purpose:** Design an environment optimized for deep creative work by removing distractions and supporting presence
**Trigger:** "Help me design my creative space", "How do I create conditions for deep work?", "Remove distractions from my environment"
**Inputs:** Current environment description, type of creative work, constraints (budget, physical limitations), biggest current distractions
**Outputs:** Specific recommendations for environmental changes, ritual suggestions, distraction removal priorities, implementation checklist
**Reasoning:** Rubin's Shangri-La transformation provides explicit principles: empty white box philosophy, no mirrors/TVs/signs of success, unconventional recording locations. Systematic approach to environment design. Less frequently needed (setup once, not ongoing) but high impact when applied.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear principles and checklist-style outputs
- Invocable: YES - "Design my creative space", "Remove distractions"
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility: environment design for creativity
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any workspace, home office, studio
- Valuable: YES - Significant impact on creative output quality

### 5. beginner-mind-reset

**Source Pattern:** The Beginner's Mind / "No technical ability" philosophy
**Purpose:** Help someone approach a familiar problem with fresh perspective by deliberately setting aside expertise and assumptions
**Trigger:** "I'm stuck in familiar patterns", "Help me see this fresh", "Apply beginner's mind", "I keep doing the same thing"
**Inputs:** Problem or project description, prior approaches tried, expertise/assumptions that may be limiting
**Outputs:** Reframed problem statement, questions a beginner would ask, assumptions identified and suspended, unconventional approaches suggested
**Reasoning:** Rubin's explicit philosophy of "not knowing" as power: "The impossible only becomes accessible when experience has not taught us limits." Structured process to access this state. Valuable when expertise becomes a cage. Less frequent than core creative skills but high value when triggered.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Process to identify assumptions and reframe
- Invocable: YES - "Help me see this fresh", "Apply beginner's mind"
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility: perspective reset
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any domain where expertise may limit
- Valuable: YES - Unlocks innovation when stuck in patterns

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Grammy Awards & Recognition | Reference data about achievements, no actionable workflow |
| Career Phases timeline | Biographical information, historical reference only |
| Key Collaborations (specific) | Case studies and examples, reference material for context |
| Famous Quotes collection | Reference material, provides flavor not process |
| Meditation Practice details | Personal spiritual practice, too context-dependent to generalize |
| The Source (Creative Act concept) | Philosophical concept without actionable steps |
| Phases of Creative Projects | General framework from book, too broad to be single skill |
| Genre list (hip-hop, metal, etc.) | Reference categorization, no workflow |
| Integration Notes | Meta-guidance, not invocable as standalone |
| Specific album stories | Narrative examples, reference material |
