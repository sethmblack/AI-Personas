## HIGH Priority

### 1. ooda-loop-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The OODA Loop / Operating Inside the Enemy's OODA Loop
**Purpose:** Analyze any competitive or conflictual situation through Boyd's Observe-Orient-Decide-Act framework to identify tempo advantages, bottlenecks, and opportunities to get inside the opponent's decision cycle.
**Trigger:** "Analyze the OODA dynamics" or "Who's cycling faster?" or "Where's the decision bottleneck?"
**Inputs:** Description of competitive situation, parties involved, current decision-making processes
**Outputs:** OODA analysis for each party, identification of tempo advantages/disadvantages, recommendations for accelerating your cycle or disrupting opponent's cycle
**Reasoning:** This is Boyd's core contribution - a universal model for competitive interaction. Highly reusable across business, sports, military, personal decisions. Provides clear analytical structure with actionable outputs.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 10 - Four-phase model with explicit analysis at each step, clear output structure
- Invocable: 9 - Natural trigger phrases, recognizable framework name
- Scoped: 9 - Focused on decision-cycle dynamics in competitive situations
- Reusable: 10 - Universal applicability to any competitive domain
- Valuable: 10 - Transforms vague "we need to be faster" into specific tempo analysis

**Score: 48/50 - HIGH**

### 2. orientation-audit

**Source Pattern:** Orientation Components / "Orientation is the Schwerpunkt"
**Purpose:** Examine the mental models, assumptions, and biases shaping how a person or organization perceives situations. Identify outdated orientations that lead to poor decisions.
**Trigger:** "Check my orientation" or "What assumptions am I making?" or "Why do I keep making the same mistake?"
**Inputs:** Description of decisions being made, historical pattern of choices, stated beliefs and frameworks
**Outputs:** Identification of orientation factors (genetic heritage, culture, experience, information), outdated or invalid assumptions, recommendations for reorientation
**Reasoning:** Boyd identified orientation as the schwerpunkt of the OODA loop - the critical element that shapes everything else. This skill directly addresses the most important and most overlooked aspect of decision-making.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9 - Clear factors to examine, specific output categories
- Invocable: 9 - Natural trigger when facing repeated failures or questioning assumptions
- Scoped: 9 - Focused specifically on the orientation component
- Reusable: 10 - Applies to individuals, teams, organizations in any domain
- Valuable: 10 - Addresses root cause of bad decisions (bad mental models)

**Score: 47/50 - HIGH**

### 3. to-be-or-to-do-assessment

**Source Pattern:** "To Be or To Do" Speech / Choice and Character
**Purpose:** Force clarity on the fundamental choice between pursuing career advancement/institutional approval versus pursuing impact and truth. Diagnose when someone is optimizing for the wrong thing.
**Trigger:** "Am I playing politics?" or "Should I compromise here?" or "To be or to do?"
**Inputs:** Description of career/ethical dilemma, competing pressures (institutional vs. impact), current choices being made
**Outputs:** Clear diagnosis of which path is being prioritized, consequences of each path, challenge to commit to one direction
**Reasoning:** Boyd's most famous non-strategic contribution. Forces clarity on a universal dilemma that most people avoid confronting. High value in any organization where politics exist.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 8 - Binary choice framework with clear criteria for diagnosis
- Invocable: 10 - Iconic phrase serves as perfect trigger
- Scoped: 9 - Focused on career/impact trade-off decisions
- Reusable: 10 - Universal across any organizational context
- Valuable: 9 - Clarifies what's often deliberately kept murky

**Score: 46/50 - HIGH**

### 4. maneuver-vs-attrition-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Maneuver Warfare vs. Attrition Warfare
**Purpose:** Diagnose whether a strategy is based on attrition (outspending, outworking) or maneuver (outthinking, disrupting). Identify opportunities to shift from attrition to maneuver approach.
**Trigger:** "Am I just trying to outwork them?" or "Is there a maneuver option?" or "How do I win with fewer resources?"
**Inputs:** Current strategy, resource comparison with competition, approach to conflict
**Outputs:** Classification of current approach (attrition vs. maneuver), identification of schwerpunkt, recommendation for maneuver alternatives, surfaces and gaps analysis
**Reasoning:** Many organizations default to attrition thinking without recognizing it. This skill makes the distinction explicit and identifies maneuver alternatives. Particularly valuable when resources are limited.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9 - Clear binary classification with specific criteria, surfaces/gaps analysis
- Invocable: 9 - Natural triggers when facing resource constraints
- Scoped: 9 - Focused on strategic approach classification
- Reusable: 10 - Applies to business, sports, military, personal competition
- Valuable: 10 - Identifies inefficient strategies and alternatives

**Score: 47/50 - HIGH**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. implicit-guidance-design

**Source Pattern:** Implicit Guidance and Control / Organic Design for Command and Control
**Purpose:** Design organizational processes that operate through implicit guidance rather than explicit control. Build systems where shared orientation enables fast, autonomous action.
**Trigger:** "How do we move faster as a team?" or "Our approval process is too slow" or "How do we decentralize decisions?"
**Inputs:** Current decision-making processes, approval structures, communication patterns
**Outputs:** Analysis of explicit vs. implicit elements, recommendations for building shared orientation, mission-type order design, trust-building requirements
**Reasoning:** Boyd's organizational design principles derived from OODA. Valuable for anyone designing teams or processes, but slightly more abstract and harder to apply than the core analytical frameworks.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 8 - Clear framework but implementation is organization-dependent
- Invocable: 8 - Triggers exist but less iconic than OODA or "to be or to do"
- Scoped: 8 - Broader scope (organizational design) than single-decision frameworks
- Reusable: 9 - Applies to any organization with decision-making processes
- Valuable: 9 - High value but requires longer-term implementation

**Score: 42/50 - HIGH (borderline)**

### 6. destruction-and-creation-cycle

**Source Pattern:** Destruction and Creation essay
**Purpose:** Apply Boyd's creative thinking methodology: destroy existing mental models through analysis, then create new ones through synthesis. Break paradigms to enable innovation.
**Trigger:** "I'm stuck in old thinking" or "How do I innovate here?" or "My framework isn't working"
**Inputs:** Current mental model or framework, evidence it's not working, available conceptual pieces
**Outputs:** Analysis (destruction) of current model into components, synthesis (creation) of new model from pieces, identification of what to preserve vs. discard
**Reasoning:** Boyd's epistemological foundation for all his strategic work. Powerful for innovation and paradigm shifts but more abstract than tactical frameworks.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 7 - Clear concept but process is inherently creative/ambiguous
- Invocable: 8 - Triggers when stuck or seeking innovation
- Scoped: 8 - Applies to any mental model or framework
- Reusable: 9 - Universal creative methodology
- Valuable: 8 - High value for innovation, but less concrete than OODA

**Score: 40/50 - HIGH (borderline)**
