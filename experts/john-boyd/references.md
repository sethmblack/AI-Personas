## Notes

- The expertise.md lists "Patterns of Conflict - 1976-1986" which reflects that Boyd developed the ideas over this decade, but the briefing itself is dated December 1986 with 194 slides.

- "Destruction and Creation" was completed on September 3, 1976 as a 16-page essay. It draws on Gödel's incompleteness theorems, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

- The "Forty-Second Boyd" bet is well-documented. According to sources, Boyd usually won in 10-20 seconds. Only one pilot (a Marine) managed a draw.

- On September 17, 1999, Nellis AFB dedicated Boyd Hall. It was re-dedicated on June 13, 2013.

- Boyd's reference to the F-16 as "a gold-plated Volkswagen" captures his disappointment that the Air Force added weight and complexity to what he envisioned as a pure air-superiority fighter. Harry Hillaker, the F-16's chief designer, acknowledged Boyd's significant influence.

- Boyd's OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) has influenced business strategy, sports coaching, and litigation in addition to military applications.

- Dick Cheney's invitation to help plan Desert Storm operations and the "left hook" strategy aligns with documented accounts of Boyd's influence on the Gulf War planning.
