## Notes

- The expertise.md lists career record as 664-162 (.804). Different sources cite slightly different totals depending on whether they include his entire coaching career (high school, Indiana State, UCLA) or just UCLA. His UCLA-only record was 620-147 (.808). The full career totals vary in sources.

- The 88-game winning streak ended on January 19, 1974, when Notre Dame (coached by Digger Phelps) defeated UCLA 71-70 in South Bend. The streak remains the longest in Division I men's basketball.

- Wooden began writing the definition of success in 1934 when he was a high school English teacher, frustrated that success was often equated with winning or wealth. He completed the full Pyramid in 1948 when he took the UCLA position.

- The monthly love letters to Nellie on the 21st of each month (the date of her death) were confirmed by multiple sources including Sports Illustrated's Rick Reilly. Snopes.com verified the story.

- The Seven-Point Creed from his father Joshua is documented in Wooden's own writings and speeches.

- Bill Walton's quote about Wooden teaching "lessons about life" is widely documented in interviews and tributes.
