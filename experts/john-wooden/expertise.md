## Key Frameworks Overview

### The Pyramid of Success

Wooden spent 15 years developing this framework, completing it in 1948. It consists of 15 building blocks organized in five tiers, with success defined not as winning but as "peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable."

**Tiers:**
- Foundation Level: Industriousness, Friendship, Loyalty, Cooperation, Enthusiasm
- Second Level: Self-Control, Alertness, Initiative, Intentness
- Third Level (Heart): Condition, Skill, Team Spirit
- Fourth Level: Poise, Confidence
- Apex: Competitive Greatness

**The Mortar (Qualities Holding the Pyramid Together):**
Ambition, Sincerity, Adaptability, Honesty, Resourcefulness, Reliability, Fight, Integrity, Faith, Patience

### The Seven-Point Creed

Given to Wooden by his father Joshua upon graduating from eighth grade:

1. **Be true to yourself** - Your character is what you truly are
2. **Help others** - Service to others brings the greatest satisfaction
3. **Make each day your masterpiece** - Focus entirely on today's effort
4. **Drink deeply from good books, especially the Bible** - Continuous learning and spiritual grounding
5. **Make friendship a fine art** - Invest in genuine relationships
6. **Build a shelter against a rainy day by the life you live** - Your character is your protection
7. **Pray for guidance and give thanks for your blessings each day** - Gratitude and humility

### The Two Sets of Three

Wooden's father also gave him "Two Sets of Three" principles:

**Never:**
- Never lie
- Never cheat
- Never steal

**Don't:**
- Don't whine
- Don't complain
- Don't make excuses

## Famous Maxims ("Woodenisms")

### On Success
- "Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable."
- "Never try to be better than someone else. Learn from others, and try to be the best you can be."
- "Success is never final, failure is never fatal. It's courage that counts."
- "Winning takes talent, to repeat takes character."

### On Preparation
- "Failing to prepare is preparing to fail."
- "If you don't have time to do it right, when will you have the time to do it over?"
- "The time to prepare isn't after you have been given the opportunity. It's long before that opportunity arises."

### On Character
- "Be more concerned with your character than your reputation, because your character is what you really are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are."
- "Ability may get you to the top, but it takes character to keep you there."
- "The true test of a man's character is what he does when no one is watching."

### On Learning and Growth
- "It's what you learn after you know it all that counts."
- "Discipline yourself, and others won't need to."
- "If we magnified blessings as much as we magnify disappointments, we would all be much happier."
- "Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out."

### On Effort
- "Make each day your masterpiece."
- "Don't let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do."
- "Never mistake activity for achievement."

### On Talent and Humility
- "Talent is God given. Be humble. Fame is man-given. Be grateful. Conceit is self-given. Be careful."
- "Consider the rights of others before your own feelings, and the feelings of others before your own rights."

### On Teams
- "The main ingredient of stardom is the rest of the team."
- "A player who makes a team great is more valuable than a great player."
