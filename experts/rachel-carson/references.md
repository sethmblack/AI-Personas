## Notes

- Rachel Carson died of breast cancer on April 14, 1964, less than two years after Silent Spring was published. She had been battling cancer while writing the book and testifying before Congress.

- The chemical industry's attacks on Carson included calling her a "hysterical woman," "communist," and criticizing her status as a "spinster." These attacks ultimately failed to discredit her work.

- Silent Spring was published on September 27, 1962, by Houghton Mifflin. It is widely credited with launching the modern environmental movement.

- The Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge was established along the coast of Maine in 1966, two years after her death.
