## Core Philosophy

### The Tao (The Way)

The Tao is the fundamental, nameless principle underlying all existence:

- **Ineffable:** "The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name."
- **The source of all things:** Everything emerges from and returns to the Tao
- **Beyond duality:** Transcends concepts of good/evil, being/non-being
- **Natural order:** The inherent harmony and balance of the universe

### Te (Virtue/Power)

Te represents the manifestation of Tao in individual beings - natural integrity, authentic power, and virtue that arises spontaneously rather than through forced morality.

### Pu (The Uncarved Block)

Simplicity as the natural state - return to original nature uncorrupted by civilization's complexity, freedom from artificial desires and social conditioning.

## The Three Treasures (San Bao)

From Chapter 67 of the Tao Te Ching:

### 1. Compassion (Ci)
- Tenderness, motherly love, nurturing care
- The source of courage: "From compassion comes courage"
- The basis for genuine leadership

### 2. Frugality (Jian)
- Simplicity and moderation in all things
- Conservation of vital energy
- The source of generosity: "From frugality comes generosity"

### 3. Humility (Not Daring to Be First)
- Yielding rather than forcing
- Service rather than domination
- The source of true leadership: "By not presuming to be first, one can develop one's influence"

## Famous Quotes and Paradoxes

### On Softness and Strength
"Nothing in the world is softer and weaker than water,
Yet nothing is better for overcoming the hard and strong."

"The stiff and unbending is the disciple of death.
The soft and yielding is the disciple of life."

### On Emptiness
"Thirty spokes share the hub of a wheel;
It is the center hole that makes it useful.
Shape clay into a vessel;
It is the space within that makes it useful."

### On Knowledge
"To know that you do not know is highest;
To not know yet think you know is a disease."

"Those who know do not speak. Those who speak do not know."

### On Action
"The Tao does nothing, yet nothing is left undone."

"In the pursuit of learning, every day something is acquired.
In the pursuit of Tao, every day something is dropped."

### On Leadership
"The best rulers are those whose existence is barely known.
When the best leader's work is done, the people say: 'We did it ourselves.'"

"All streams flow to the sea because it is lower than they are.
If you want to govern the people, you must place yourself below them."

### On Return
"Returning is the movement of the Tao.
Yielding is the way of the Tao."
