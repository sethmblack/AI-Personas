## Detailed Analysis

### 1. democratic-design-evaluation (HIGH)

**Source Methodology:**
IKEA's Democratic Design framework evaluates products against five dimensions: form, function, quality, sustainability, and low price. All five must be in balance for true success.

**Why It's a Skill:**
- **Actionable:** Clear framework with five testable criteria
- **Invocable:** "Does this product meet all five dimensions?" / evaluation needed
- **Scoped:** Focused on multi-dimensional evaluation
- **Reusable:** Applies to any product, service, or solution design
- **Valuable:** Prevents optimization of one dimension at expense of others

**Key Differentiator:** Forces balance rather than tradeoffs. The goal is not to choose between quality and price, but to achieve both through innovation.

---

### 2. constraint-innovation (HIGH)

**Source Methodology:**
When Swedish furniture makers boycotted IKEA in 1955, Kamprad turned the constraint into advantage by designing own furniture and finding Polish suppliers. The 1970 fire led to self-service discovery. Flat-pack emerged from shipping constraints.

**Why It's a Skill:**
- **Actionable:** Protocol for reframing limitations as opportunities
- **Invocable:** "We can't afford..." / "We're blocked by..." / resource limitations
- **Scoped:** Focused on constraint transformation
- **Reusable:** Any situation with limitations
- **Valuable:** Systematic innovation from adversity

**Key Differentiator:** Not accepting constraints but actively seeking the innovation hidden within them.

---

### 3. cost-first-design (HIGH)

**Source Methodology:**
"Any designer can design a desk that will cost 5,000 kronor. But only the most skilled can design a good, functional desk that will cost 100 kronor."

IKEA designs backward from target price to solution, not forward from design to price.

**Why It's a Skill:**
- **Actionable:** Start with price, work backward to solution
- **Invocable:** "This costs too much" / pricing strategy / budget constraints
- **Scoped:** Price-driven development methodology
- **Reusable:** Any product or service development
- **Valuable:** Prevents cost overruns by making price a design input

**Key Differentiator:** Price as input, not output. Design serves the price constraint.

---

### 4. smaland-simplification (HIGH)

**Source Methodology:**
"Complicated rules paralyze." "Simplicity and common sense should characterize planning and strategic direction."

The Smaland "lista" approach: make do with less, find simple solutions, eliminate unnecessary complexity.

**Why It's a Skill:**
- **Actionable:** Protocol for identifying and eliminating unnecessary complexity
- **Invocable:** "This is too complicated" / process improvement / bureaucracy reduction
- **Scoped:** Focused on simplification methodology
- **Reusable:** Any process, rule, or system
- **Valuable:** Enables scale by reducing friction

**Key Differentiator:** Simplicity as strength, not compromise. Complex solutions reveal incomplete thinking.

---

### 5. ten-minute-rule (MEDIUM)

**Why MEDIUM:**
- Clear and actionable time management principle
- More individual than organizational
- Better as reference principle than full skill

---

### 6-8. (LOW Priority)

**Why LOW:**
- Self-service-design: Valuable but service-industry specific
- Flat-pack-thinking: Physical product logistics specific
- Catalog-marketing: Publication/marketing specific

---

## Skills to Create

Based on analysis, creating **4 skills**:

1. **democratic-design-evaluation** - Multi-dimensional product/service evaluation
2. **constraint-innovation** - Transforming limitations into competitive advantages
3. **cost-first-design** - Price-driven development methodology
4. **smaland-simplification** - Systematic complexity reduction

---

## Cross-References

### Existing Related Skills

Check for overlap with:
- `lean-waste-elimination` - Different focus (waste vs. complexity)
- `first-principles-thinking` - Complementary approaches
- `value-engineering` - Similar cost focus, different framework

### Potential Expert Combinations

- **Sam Walton:** Both emphasize frugality and serving ordinary people; Walton for retail operations, Kamprad for product design
- **Dieter Rams:** Both emphasize simplicity and quality; Rams for pure design, Kamprad for affordable design
- **Henry Ford:** Both democratized products; Ford for manufacturing, Kamprad for retail
- **Charlie Munger:** Both emphasize inverting problems; Munger for thinking, Kamprad for design

## Notes

### Unique Contributions

Kamprad's distinctive value is the insistence that quality and low price are not tradeoffs but challenges to be solved through innovation. This is different from:
- Premium design (high quality, high price)
- Discount retail (low quality, low price)
- Value engineering (reducing quality to meet price)

Democratic Design demands all five dimensions simultaneously.

### Controversy Handling

Skills should not ignore the Nazi youth controversy but acknowledge it appropriately when relevant to discussions of leadership, ethics, or personal history.
