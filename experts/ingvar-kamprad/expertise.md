## The Testament of a Furniture Dealer (1976)

Kamprad wrote this internal manifesto to preserve IKEA culture as the company expanded. It remains the company's philosophical foundation.

### The Nine Theses

#### 1. The Product Range - Our Identity
"We shall offer a wide range of well-designed, functional home furnishing products at prices so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them."

#### 2. The IKEA Spirit - A Strong and Living Reality
"The true IKEA spirit is still built on our enthusiasm, on our constant will to renew, on our cost-consciousness, on our willingness to assume responsibility and to help, on our humbleness before the task and on the simplicity of our behavior."

#### 3. Profit Gives Us Resources
"A better everyday life for the many people! To achieve our aim, we must have resources—especially in the area of finance. We do not believe in waiting for ripe plums to fall into our mouths."

#### 4. Reaching Good Results with Small Means
"Expensive solutions to any kind of problem are usually the work of mediocrity. We have no respect for a solution until we know what it costs."

#### 5. Simplicity is a Virtue
"Complicated rules paralyse! The more complicated the rules, the harder it is to comply with them. Complicated planning becomes meaningless in practice."

#### 6. Doing it a Different Way
"If we from the start had consulted experts about whether a little community like Almhult could support a company like IKEA, they would have told us firmly that we'd have to look at different options. By doing it differently we got around the so-called 'small town disadvantage.'"

#### 7. Concentration - Important to Our Success
"The general who divides his resources will invariably be defeated. Even a multitalented businessman or businesswoman has limited resources."

#### 8. Taking Responsibility - A Privilege
"Fear of making mistakes is the root of bureaucracy and the enemy of development. The healthy fear of mistakes is something completely different."

#### 9. Most Things Still Remain to Be Done - A Glorious Future!
"The feeling of having finished something is an effective sleeping pill. A person who retires feeling that he has done his bit will quickly wither away."

## The Democratic Design Framework

### Origins
The concept was formally presented at the Milan Furniture Fair in 1995, though the philosophy had guided IKEA since its founding. It codifies Kamprad's belief that good design should not require wealth.

### The Five Dimensions

#### 1. Form
The aesthetic appeal - what attracts the eye. Products should be beautiful in a Scandinavian way: clean, simple, timeless.

#### 2. Function
The practical purpose - products must serve their stated purpose effectively. A chair must be comfortable, a shelf must hold books.

#### 3. Quality
Durability and craftsmanship - products should last. "IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad was always determined to offer the best possible prices but not at the expense of quality."

#### 4. Sustainability
Environmental responsibility - materials should be renewable, production should minimize harm, products should enable sustainable living.

#### 5. Low Price
Affordability - products must be priced so ordinary families can afford them. "We have decided to side with the many."

### Application
All five dimensions must be in balance. A beautiful chair that falls apart is a failure. A durable chair that costs too much is a failure. A cheap chair that harms the environment is a failure. True Democratic Design achieves all five.

## Key Innovations

### Flat-Pack Furniture (1956)
**The Origin Story:** Gillis Lundgren, IKEA's fourth employee, was photographing a table for the catalog. It wouldn't fit in his car. He unscrewed the legs and put them under the tabletop. Kamprad immediately saw the implications for shipping and storage.

**The Impact:**
- Reduced shipping costs by eliminating "transported air"
- Enabled customer self-transport
- Lowered warehouse requirements
- Created the assembly-at-home model
- First product: LOVET table (1956), still sold today as LOVBACKEN

### Self-Service Retail (1965-1971)
**The Accident:** A 1970 fire at Kungens Kurva forced a temporary warehouse setup. Customers began picking their own boxes directly from shelves. They loved it.

**The Innovation:** When the store reopened in 1971, self-service became permanent, eliminating traditional furniture sales staff and dramatically reducing labor costs.

### The One-Way Store Layout
**The Design:** Customers follow a predetermined path through the entire showroom, seeing every product category. Inspired by the Guggenheim Museum's spiral design.

**The Effect:** Increased exposure to products, created a "treasure hunt" experience, and reduced the need for sales staff.

### The In-Store Restaurant
**The Logic:** "You can't do business with someone who is hungry." Swedish meatballs became synonymous with IKEA, keeping customers in stores longer.

### The Catalog as Marketing
**The Scale:** At peak, 200+ million copies annually - one of the most widely read publications on Earth.

**The Purpose:** Brought the showroom into homes, democratized design inspiration, created aspirational imagery for ordinary living.

## Famous Anecdotes

### The 1993 Volvo
Despite being worth an estimated $58 billion at his death, Kamprad drove a 1993 Volvo 240 GL for over two decades. When asked why, he reportedly said: "I don't think my car's particularly bad. I use it for two purposes: going to the store and driving down to the estate where I like to hunt."

He only gave it up when persuaded it had become unsafe.

### The Haircut Strategy
Kamprad paid $27 for a haircut in the Netherlands in 2008 and considered it too expensive. He told a Swedish newspaper: "Normally, I try to get my haircut when I'm in a developing country. Last time it was in Vietnam."

### The Flea Market Wardrobe
In a 2014 Swedish television appearance, Kamprad said: "If you look at me now, I don't think I'm wearing anything that wasn't bought at a flea market."

### The Meatballs
Kamprad ate in IKEA restaurants regularly and reportedly criticized his own stores if the meatballs weren't up to standard. The restaurant was never an afterthought - it was central to the customer experience.

### The Budget Travel Culture
IKEA executives shared motel rooms, flew economy, and were expected to find the cheapest options. Kamprad led by example. The company did not have a corporate jet until after Kamprad stepped down, despite annual revenues exceeding $40 billion.

### The Fire That Created Self-Service
The 1970 Kungens Kurva fire was initially a disaster. But when customers loved picking their own flat-packs from the temporary warehouse arrangement, Kamprad immediately recognized a permanent innovation. The constraint became the advantage.

### The Napkin Bookcase
Gillis Lundgren sketched the Billy bookcase on the back of a napkin. It became IKEA's most iconic product - over 140 million sold, one every five seconds.

## Historical Controversy

### Nazi Youth Involvement
In 1943, the same year he founded IKEA, the 17-year-old Kamprad became involved with Swedish fascist organizations, including the New Swedish Movement led by Per Engdahl. Swedish security services opened a file on him labeled "Nazi."

**The Revelation:** The involvement was not publicly known until 1994, when Swedish newspaper Expressen published evidence.

**Kamprad's Response:** He wrote an apology letter titled "The Greatest Mistake of My Life" to IKEA's 25,000 employees. He blamed his grandmother's German heritage and influence.

**Complexity:** His first employee and close friend was Otto Ullmann, an Austrian Jewish refugee whose parents had sent him to Sweden to escape Nazi persecution. Ullmann's family reported he was angry when the fascist connections were revealed in the 1990s.

**Later Statements:** Kamprad continued to describe Per Engdahl as "a great man" into old age, while simultaneously denouncing fascism and stating the involvement was his greatest regret.

**IKEA's Response:** In 2011, following publication of Elisabeth Asbrink's book with further details, IKEA made a $51 million donation to the United Nations High Commission on Refugees - the largest single donation in the organization's history.

**Assessment:** The controversy remains part of Kamprad's legacy. He never fully explained the contradiction between his stated regret and his continued defense of Engdahl personally. The mistakes were real and serious, as was the subsequent building of a company that served millions of ordinary families worldwide.

## The Smaland Influence

### Geographic Context
Smaland is a province in southern Sweden historically associated with poverty, hard work, and resourcefulness. The rocky soil made farming difficult, breeding a culture of frugality and ingenuity.

### The Concept of "Lista"
A Smaland term meaning to make do, to find creative solutions with limited resources. This philosophy permeated IKEA's culture:
- Never waste materials
- Find multiple uses for everything
- Simple solutions over complex ones
- Resourcefulness over resources

### Kamprad's Articulation
"It is in the nature of Smaland to be thrifty. The people of Smaland are known for working hard, living on slender means, and using their heads to make the best possible use of the limited resources that they have."

### Cultural Legacy
Smaland values became IKEA values: frugality, simplicity, hard work, equality, and the belief that constraints drive innovation rather than prevent it.

## Key Relationships

### Gillis Lundgren (Designer, Employee #4)
**Role:** Joined 1954 as advertising manager; became creative director and primary designer
**Contributions:** IKEA logo design, flat-pack concept, Billy bookcase, LOVET table, catalog design
**Relationship:** Kamprad's creative partner who translated frugal philosophy into physical products
**Quote:** "I just unscrewed the legs and put them under the tabletop."

### Per Engdahl (Controversial Figure)
**Role:** Leader of New Swedish Movement, Swedish fascist organization
**Relationship:** Kamprad was involved with his organization in youth; continued to defend him personally even while renouncing fascism
**Controversy:** Central to Kamprad's most difficult legacy

### Otto Ullmann (First Employee)
**Background:** Austrian Jewish refugee whose parents sent him to Sweden to escape Nazis
**Paradox:** Worked alongside Kamprad during the period of fascist involvement
**Later:** Reportedly angry and refused to forgive when the fascist connections were revealed

---

## Failures and Mistakes

### The Nazi Youth Period
The most significant mistake of Kamprad's life by his own admission. Decades of subsequent business success did not erase this shadow.

### Tax Exile (1973-2014)
Left Sweden in 1973 for tax reasons, living in Denmark and later Switzerland. Returned only in 2014, having spent most of his adult life outside his homeland. While legally defensible, it conflicted with his public image of Smaland simplicity.

### Complexity of Corporate Structure
Created an extremely complex ownership structure involving Dutch foundations and Luxembourg holding companies. While designed for longevity and tax efficiency, it contradicted his stated love of simplicity.

### Early Catalog Quality
Before the showroom in 1953, customers ordered furniture they couldn't see and sometimes received poor quality. This led to the realization that people needed to experience products before buying.
