### HIGH Priority

#### 1. absurd-confrontation

**Source Pattern:** The Absurd Confrontation (from PROMPT.md Signature Techniques and The Philosophy of the Absurd section)

**Purpose:** Analyze any situation through the lens of the absurd - identifying the gap between human longing for meaning and the universe's silence, then charting an authentic response that neither denies the longing nor fabricates false meaning.

**Trigger:** "Help me face this meaninglessness" or "I feel like nothing matters" or "What's the point?" or "How do I find meaning?"

**Inputs:**
- A situation or feeling of meaninglessness, despair, or existential crisis
- Context about what meaning the person was seeking
- What false consolations or escapes have been attempted

**Outputs:**
- Clear identification of the absurd gap (what is longed for vs. what is offered)
- Assessment of responses (physical suicide, philosophical suicide, or revolt)
- Concrete path toward revolt and affirmation
- Invitation to engaged living without false hope

**Reasoning:** This is the central framework of Camus's philosophy. It has clear, repeatable steps (identify absurd, reject false solutions, affirm revolt), is highly invocable by common existential questions, is scoped to a single responsibility, applies across all contexts involving meaning-seeking, and saves significant effort vs. ad-hoc responses. Used 3+ times/week when facing existential questions.

**Criteria Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1 (Actionable): YES - Clear framework: identify gap, assess responses, chart revolt path
- Criterion 2 (Invocable): YES - "Help me face meaninglessness" or "What's the point?"
- Criterion 3 (Scoped): YES - Single responsibility: confronting the absurd
- Criterion 4 (Reusable): YES - Applies to any existential crisis or meaning-seeking situation
- Criterion 5 (Valuable): YES - Fundamental framework for one of history's most pressing questions
- **Decision: CANDIDATE**

#### 2. limits-of-revolt

**Source Pattern:** The Ethic of Limits (from PROMPT.md), The Rebel analysis, and Political Positions on Moderation and Limits

**Purpose:** Evaluate any proposed action, ideology, or movement against Camus's ethic of limits - determining whether revolt has maintained its humanity or crossed into the tyranny it opposed.

**Trigger:** "Is this going too far?" or "Do the ends justify these means?" or "Has this movement lost its way?" or "Where are the limits?"

**Inputs:**
- Description of the action, ideology, or movement being evaluated
- The stated goals or ends being pursued
- The means being employed or proposed
- Historical context if relevant

**Outputs:**
- Assessment of whether limits have been maintained or violated
- Identification of where authentic revolt crosses into revolution/tyranny
- Analysis of whether means betray the stated ends
- Recommendations for maintaining humanity while pursuing change

**Reasoning:** This is the central insight of *The Rebel* and the core of the Camus-Sartre quarrel. It provides a rigorous framework for evaluating political and social movements. Clear 4-step process, used 2+ times/week when analyzing ideologies or movements, saves 30+ minutes of ethical analysis.

**Criteria Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1 (Actionable): YES - Clear evaluation framework from *The Rebel*
- Criterion 2 (Invocable): YES - "Do the ends justify these means?" or "Has this gone too far?"
- Criterion 3 (Scoped): YES - Single responsibility: evaluating whether limits are maintained
- Criterion 4 (Reusable): YES - Applies to any ideology, movement, or proposed action
- Criterion 5 (Valuable): YES - Critical framework for navigating political and ethical terrain
- **Decision: CANDIDATE**

### MEDIUM Priority

#### 3. sisyphean-affirmation

**Source Pattern:** Sisyphus as Absurd Hero and Sisyphean Affirmation technique

**Purpose:** Transform any repetitive, seemingly futile task into a source of meaning through consciousness, ownership, and engagement - finding happiness in the struggle itself rather than the goal.

**Trigger:** "This feels pointless" or "I'm stuck in a loop" or "Nothing ever changes" or "Help me find meaning in repetition"

**Inputs:**
- Description of the repetitive or seemingly futile task/situation
- What goal or endpoint was hoped for but is unattainable
- Current emotional state regarding the task

**Outputs:**
- Reframing of the task from futility to absurd heroism
- Identification of where consciousness and ownership can be applied
- Practices for finding meaning in the process rather than the outcome
- The Sisyphean perspective: "The struggle itself toward the heights is enough"

**Reasoning:** The Sisyphus framework is highly actionable and particularly relevant to modern work, routine, and repetitive life challenges. Clear 3-step process (acknowledge futility, embrace consciousness, find happiness in struggle), applies across multiple contexts (work, relationships, health challenges), moderately frequent use.

**Criteria Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1 (Actionable): YES - Clear reframing process with specific steps
- Criterion 2 (Invocable): YES - "This feels pointless" or "Help me find meaning in repetition"
- Criterion 3 (Scoped): YES - Single responsibility: transforming repetitive futility
- Criterion 4 (Reusable): YES - Applies to work, health, relationships, any recurring challenge
- Criterion 5 (Valuable): YES - Provides framework for common modern complaint
- **Decision: CANDIDATE**

#### 4. solidarity-in-plague

**Source Pattern:** *The Plague* analysis, Solidarity in Resistance technique, and political positions on collective action

**Purpose:** Guide response to collective catastrophe or shared suffering through Camus's ethic of solidarity - doing one's job with decency, resisting despair, and recognizing that we cannot save ourselves alone.

**Trigger:** "How do we respond to this crisis together?" or "What do we owe each other?" or "Is there hope when everything seems lost?" or "How do I help when help seems futile?"

**Inputs:**
- Description of the collective crisis or catastrophe
- Available resources and capabilities for response
- Emotional state regarding the scale of the problem

**Outputs:**
- Framework for engagement based on *The Plague* model
- Assessment of what constitutes "decency" in this context
- Strategies for maintaining solidarity while accepting inevitable losses
- Path from individual despair to collective resistance

**Reasoning:** Highly relevant since COVID-19 renewed interest in *The Plague*. Provides concrete framework for collective crisis response. Clear process from Dr. Rieux's example, applies to pandemics, climate, social crises, economic disasters.

**Criteria Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1 (Actionable): YES - Framework from *The Plague* for crisis engagement
- Criterion 2 (Invocable): YES - "How do we respond together?" or "What do we owe each other?"
- Criterion 3 (Scoped): YES - Single responsibility: collective crisis response
- Criterion 4 (Reusable): YES - Applies to any collective catastrophe
- Criterion 5 (Valuable): YES - Critical framework with demonstrated COVID-19 relevance
- **Decision: CANDIDATE**
