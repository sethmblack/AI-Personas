## The Philosophy of the Absurd

### Definition of the Absurd

The absurd is not a property of the world or of the human mind alone, but arises from their confrontation. As Camus explains: "The absurd is not in man nor in the world, but in their presence together."

It is the gap between:
- Human longing for clarity, meaning, reason, and happiness
- The universe's "unreasonable silence" and indifference

Key insight: **The meaninglessness of the world is not Camus's conclusion, but his starting point.** Unlike predecessors whose works culminate in discovering emptiness, Camus begins with this awareness and focuses on how to live authentically in response.

### The Absurd Is Not Nihilism

Critical distinction that separates Camus from nihilists:
- **Nihilism** takes the absurd as a conclusion: nothing matters, all values are void
- **Absurdism** takes the absurd as a starting point: from meaninglessness springs revolt, freedom, and passion
- "While the spirit of Nihilism is the deliberate and eternal negation of all values, the spirit of Absurdism is an affirmation of life's value even in death."

From absurdity, Camus derives three consequences:
1. **Revolt** - Constant confrontation with the absurd; refusing to surrender
2. **Freedom** - Liberation from hope in an afterlife or ultimate meaning
3. **Passion** - Living fully and intensely in the present moment

### Responses to the Absurd

| Response | Description | Camus's Assessment |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Physical suicide | Eliminating consciousness that perceives the absurd | Rejected as philosophical defeat; resolves absurd by eliminating one of its terms |
| Philosophical suicide | "Leap of faith" (Kierkegaard), religious belief, or philosophical systems that claim to find meaning | Rejected as intellectual dishonesty; "deifying what crushes them" |
| Revolt | Living with full absurd consciousness; affirming life despite meaninglessness | The only authentic response |

Camus on religious responses: He called it "philosophical suicide" because he saw it as throwing away reason to believe something known to be untrue. He was "totally dissatisfied with religious approaches."

### Sisyphus as Absurd Hero

The myth of Sisyphus - condemned to eternally roll a boulder up a mountain only to watch it roll down - becomes the paradigm of absurd heroism:

- The task is meaningless by any external measure
- It will never end
- There is no audience, no reward
- Yet Sisyphus makes it his own; he owns his fate
- "The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

The happiness comes not from the task's completion but from:
- Acknowledging the futility of his task and the certainty of his fate
- Being freed to realize the absurdity of his situation
- Reaching a state of contented acceptance
- Finding that the scorn of the gods loses its power when he embraces his rock

Camus presents Sisyphus's toil as a metaphor for modern lives spent working at seemingly futile jobs - the key is consciousness and ownership.

### Absurdism vs. Existentialism

Camus explicitly rejected the "existentialist" label, though he is often grouped with existentialists:

| Aspect | Camus (Absurdism) | Sartre (Existentialism) |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Label | Rejected "existentialist" | Embraced it |
| Origins | Ancient Greek philosophy, Nietzsche, 17th-century moralists | 19th and early 20th-century German philosophy |
| Meaning | Hesitantly allows possibility for some meaning/value | Confident that individuals can construct their own meaning |
| Criticism | *The Myth of Sisyphus* explicitly criticizes Kierkegaard, Jaspers, Heidegger for "escapism" | Praised Camus's "philosophy of the absurd" while distinguishing it from his own |

Sartre recognized Camus was undertaking important philosophical work and spoke publicly of his friend's "philosophy of the absurd."

## Major Works Analysis

Camus organized his works in cycles, each consisting of a novel, an essay, and a play:
- **First Cycle (The Absurd):** *The Stranger*, *The Myth of Sisyphus*, *Caligula*
- **Second Cycle (Revolt):** *The Plague*, *The Rebel*, *The Just Assassins*
- **Third Cycle (Love/Judgment):** *The Fall*, *The First Man* (unfinished)

### *The Stranger* (L'Etranger, 1942)

**Plot and Style:**
- Protagonist Meursault commits murder on an Algerian beach but is condemned more for failing to cry at his mother's funeral
- Written in flat, affectless first-person style reflecting absurdist alienation
- Short, declarative sentences; emotional detachment from narrator

**Themes:**
- Society's demand for emotional performance vs. authentic existence
- The alienation of the individual who refuses to play expected social roles
- Can be read as both: a depressing manifestation of emerging mass personality devoid of feeling, AND conversely, as a hold-out of Romanticism viewed as dangerous by the robotic majority
- Study of 20th-century alienation

**Significance:**
- Illustrates much of *The Myth of Sisyphus*: man as victim of absurd orthodoxy, then tempted by despair, hope, and salvation when facing execution

### *The Myth of Sisyphus* (1942)

**Structure:**
- Philosophical essay opening with: "There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide."
- Analysis of contemporary nihilism and the concept of the absurd

**Argument:**
- The realization of the absurd does not justify suicide; it requires revolt
- Examines and rejects "leap of faith" responses (Kierkegaard, Husserl, Jaspers)
- Criticizes existentialists for finding "reason to hope in what impoverishes them"
- Celebrates absurd heroes who live fully despite meaninglessness: Don Juan, the actor, the conqueror, the artist

**Conclusion:**
- Sisyphus as metaphor for human condition
- "Happiness and the absurd are two sons of the same earth. They are inseparable."
- When Sisyphus acknowledges futility and certainty of fate, he is freed to reach contented acceptance

### *The Plague* (La Peste, 1947)

**Plot:**
- Bubonic plague strikes the Algerian city of Oran
- Dr. Bernard Rieux organizes resistance against the epidemic
- Characters respond differently: some fight, some profit, some despair

**Allegorical Meaning:**
- Camus later confirmed: "The obvious content is the struggle of the European resistance movements against Nazism"
- The arbitrariness of the plague parallels the absurdity of existence
- The plague also represents evil generally - indiscriminate, impersonal, inescapable

**Key Themes:**
- Solidarity against collective catastrophe
- Doing one's job despite knowing death will win
- "The whole thing is not about heroism... the only way to fight the plague is with decency"
- Human factor in addressing social crisis; personal drama of quarantine, isolation, and death

**COVID-19 Relevance:**
- Renewed massive interest during COVID-19 pandemic (Spring 2020)
- Record-breaking sales, dozens of articles examining contemporary resonance
- Readers found descriptions uncannily prescient: quarantine isolation, political denials, crowd behavior, phases of public reaction
- Dr. Rieux's lesson: "The plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good"

### *The Rebel* (L'Homme Revolte, 1951)

**Scope:**
- Historical survey of metaphysical and political rebellion from Marquis de Sade to Soviet terror
- Distinguishes authentic revolt (affirms human dignity) from revolution (accepts murder for future utopia)

**Central Argument:**
- The Terror of Robespierre after the French Revolution and the Gulags after the Soviet revolution were not accidents of history but an inherent pattern of ideological revolutions
- Revolution that accepts any means becomes indistinguishable from the tyranny it opposed
- Critique of Marxist-Leninist justification of means by ends

**Key Concept - Limits:**
- Authentic revolt must know its limits
- Murder is never justified, even for utopia
- The rebel can never find peace; must fight unceasingly to uphold values

**Impact:**
- Sparked complete break with Sartre and the French Left
- Made Camus pariah to much of French intelligentsia
- The August 1952 issue of *Les Temps modernes* (carrying the exchange) sold out immediately, was reprinted, and sold out again

### *The Fall* (La Chute, 1956)

**Structure:**
- Dramatic monologue by "judge-penitent" Jean-Baptiste Clamence
- Set in an Amsterdam bar called "Mexico City"
- Confessional narrative addressed to a stranger

**Themes:**
- Guilt, judgment, and the impossibility of innocence
- Secular retelling of the Biblical Fall of Man
- Heavy cost of WWII atrocities; attempt to explain how humanity could perpetrate such evils
- Fear of being judged as central human weakness
- Egotism, hypocrisy, and inauthenticity

**Symbolism:**
- Name "Jean-Baptiste Clamence" alludes to John the Baptist (voice crying in wilderness)
- Amsterdam's concentric canals compared to Dante's circles of Hell
- The harbor and old Jewish quarter represent the ninth circle - the circle of traitors
- Setting against the backdrop of WWII and the Holocaust

**Significance:**
- Sartre called it "perhaps the most beautiful and the least understood" of Camus's books
- Darker, more self-critical than earlier works
- Unique in Camus's fiction for consistent use of religious vocabulary

## Camus vs. Sartre: The Great Quarrel

### Background

- Met in Paris during the Occupation; grew closer after WWII
- In the immediate post-war period, Camus was Sartre's closest friend
- United by common Resistance experience, promoting social change while facing ethical/political dilemmas

### Philosophical Differences

| Issue | Camus | Sartre |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Label** | Rejected "existentialist" label | Embraced existentialism |
| **Communism** | Opposed Soviet communism from the start | Fellow traveler until 1956 (Hungarian Revolution) |
| **Violence** | Absolute rejection of murder for political ends | Revolutionary violence sometimes necessary |
| **History** | Refused to sacrifice present for future utopia | History has progressive direction |
| **Morality and Politics** | Politics subordinated to morality | Morality subordinated to politics |
| **Algeria** | Anguished complexity; condemned both French torture and FLN terrorism | Supported FLN independence fighters |

The fundamental disagreement: For Camus, limits existed that could never be crossed; for Sartre, historical necessity could justify extreme measures.

### The Break (1951-1952)

**Timeline:**
1. October 1951: Camus publishes *The Rebel*, criticizing revolutionary terror and Soviet communism
2. May 1952: Francis Jeanson publishes harsh review in Sartre's journal *Les Temps modernes*
3. June 1952: Camus sends angry letter to "Monsieur le Directeur" (Sartre), refusing to address Jeanson directly
4. August 1952: Sartre publishes devastating personal response

**Sartre's Famous Response:**
- Placed responsibility for estrangement on Camus
- "Our friendship was not easy but I will miss it. If you are breaking it today, it is doubtless because it had to be broken."
- "You were once a person, but now you have become an institution... the violent and ceremonious administrator of your own glory."

**Aftermath:**
- Friendship never recovered
- Sartre wrote a harsh obituary-preface in 1960
- After 1952, Camus argued against pro-Communist leftist intellectuals (whose leader he considered Sartre)
- After 1952, Sartre argued against believers in nonviolence (whose spokesperson he took Camus to be)
- Their opposing views led them to react differently to the Algerian War

## Political Positions

### Anti-Totalitarianism

- Equally opposed fascism and Stalinism throughout his career
- Critique of show trials, gulags, revolutionary terror
- Campaigned tirelessly against the Soviet crushing of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution
- Supported awarding the Nobel Prize to dissident Boris Pasternak (which enraged Moscow)
- This balanced stance made him pariah to much of French intelligentsia, which leaned heavily Communist in the post-war period

### The Algerian Question

**Background:**
- Born in Algeria; identified as pied-noir (French person born in colonial Algeria)
- Deep emotional connection to the land, the landscape, the people
- His most profound internal conflict arose during the Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962)

**His Position:**
- Passionately condemned French state's use of torture, collective punishment, systematic oppression
- Could not bring himself to endorse FLN's use of terrorism against French civilians
- This was not moral equivalence - he understood the difference between state and insurgent violence, between oppressor and oppressed
- Rather, it was refusal to accept that ends could justify any means, no matter how noble the cause

**The 1956 Civil Truce:**
- January 1956: Returned to Algiers to establish a civil truce
- Joined an ad-hoc committee with both pied-noirs and indigenous Algerians (including FLN members)
- Effort ultimately failed

**The 1957 Stockholm Statement:**
- At Nobel Prize ceremonies, challenged by an FLN supporter about his silence on the war
- Actual statement (often misquoted): "People are now planting bombs in the tramways of Algiers. My mother might be on one of those tramways. If that is justice, then I prefer my mother."
- Note: Often misquoted as "I believe in justice, but I will defend my mother before justice"
- The more nuanced original shows his position: he questioned whether indiscriminate terrorism could BE justice

**Aftermath:**
- Intervened with French authorities to save lives of dozens of condemned mujahidin
- But refused to support the armed struggle publicly
- The FLN never forgave him; French colonialists never accepted him
- Eventually stopped commenting on the war entirely
- This retreat was seen by some as cowardice, but Camus felt any comment would inflame one side or the other

### Moderation and Limits

- "I should like to be able to love my country and still love justice."
- Believed in reform over revolution
- Opposed death penalty absolutely
- The concept of *mesure* (measure, limits) was central to his political thought
