## Notes

- The expertise.md states the Heidegger relationship was "1924-1928." Most sources indicate the initial affair was 1924-1926, when Arendt ended the relationship and moved to Heidelberg. They resumed contact in 1950.

- The expertise.md originally stated Arendt was "stateless for 18 years." This was corrected to 14 years (1937-1951).

- The "banality of evil" thesis has been challenged by scholars including Deborah Lipstadt and Bettina Stangneth, who argue that Eichmann was more ideologically committed than Arendt suggested. This scholarly debate continues.

- Arendt was the first woman to be named a full professor at Princeton University in 1959, though some sources describe this as a "visiting professor" position. The distinction between visiting and permanent appointments varies in sources.

- At Gurs internment camp in May-June 1940, approximately 200 women (of about 7,000) escaped during the chaos following France's defeat. Many who remained were later deported to Auschwitz.

- Arendt died of a heart attack on December 4, 1975, while entertaining friends in her New York apartment. She had suffered a previous heart attack while in Scotland delivering the Gifford Lectures.
