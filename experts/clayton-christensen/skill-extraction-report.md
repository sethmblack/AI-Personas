## HIGH Priority

### 1. disruption-detection

**Source Pattern:** Disruptive Innovation Theory, Sustaining vs Disruptive Innovation
**Purpose:** Analyze a competitive threat or new entrant to determine if it represents sustaining or disruptive innovation, and predict its trajectory
**Trigger:** "Is this disruptive?", "Analyze this competitive threat", "Should we be worried about this new entrant?", "Is this technology disruptive?"
**Inputs:** Description of the new technology/product/company, current market position, customer segments being targeted
**Outputs:** Classification (sustaining/low-end disruption/new-market disruption), trajectory prediction, recommended response, specific historical parallels
**Reasoning:** This is Christensen's central framework. Clear 3-question diagnostic, used frequently in strategy discussions, saves significant analysis time by applying proven theory. Has explicit steps and produces actionable output.

### 2. jobs-to-be-done-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Jobs-to-Be-Done Framework, The Milkshake Case Study
**Purpose:** Identify the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of the job a customer is hiring a product to do, revealing true competition and opportunities for innovation
**Trigger:** "What job is this product hired to do?", "Why are customers buying this?", "Who are our real competitors?", "Why is this product failing?"
**Inputs:** Product or service description, customer context, purchase circumstances, current alternatives being considered
**Outputs:** Job statement (circumstance + progress + constraints), competing solutions for the same job, four forces analysis, recommendations for better serving the job
**Reasoning:** Christensen's most actionable product design framework. The milkshake case provides a clear template. Widely applicable across any product/service design challenge. Produces non-obvious insights about competition and positioning.

### 3. organizational-capability-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Resource-Process-Priority (RPP) Framework
**Purpose:** Assess whether an organization's capabilities are suited for a specific innovation opportunity, and identify what needs to change
**Trigger:** "Can our organization do this?", "Why are we struggling with this initiative?", "What's blocking this change?", "Do we have the capability?"
**Inputs:** Description of the innovation opportunity, organization's current resources, processes, and priorities
**Outputs:** RPP assessment matrix, capability gaps identification, recommendation (internal development, acquisition, separate organization), specific change requirements
**Reasoning:** Clear 3-component framework, directly actionable for organizational change decisions, explains why many transformations fail. Saves months of trial-and-error by diagnosing capability fit upfront.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. asymmetric-motivation-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Asymmetric Motivation Analysis, Steel Minimills case study
**Purpose:** Predict competitive dynamics by analyzing who is motivated to attack and who is motivated to retreat in a market
**Trigger:** "How will competitors respond?", "Should we pursue this market?", "Will incumbents fight back?", "What's the competitive trajectory?"
**Inputs:** Market segments, margin structures, current positions of incumbents and entrants
**Outputs:** Motivation map for each player, predicted moves, strategic windows, recommended positioning
**Reasoning:** Less frequently needed than core disruption analysis but provides critical insight for market entry and competitive strategy. Clear pattern from steel minimills and disk drive cases.

---

### 5. modular-integration-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Modular-Interdependent Spectrum
**Purpose:** Determine whether a market or product category favors integrated or modular architectures, and predict architectural evolution
**Trigger:** "Should we build or buy?", "Is this market commoditizing?", "Will this platform become modular?", "What's the future architecture?"
**Inputs:** Current product performance vs customer needs, interface stability, market maturity indicators
**Outputs:** Current position on modular-integrated spectrum, predicted direction of evolution, strategic implications (integrate vs modularize), timing estimates
**Reasoning:** Important for platform and architecture decisions. Clear analytical framework with predictable patterns. Less frequently invoked than core disruption/JTBD but critical for certain strategic decisions.

---

### 6. disruption-response-design

**Source Pattern:** Principles from The Innovator's Dilemma, RPP Framework integration
**Purpose:** Design an organizational response to a disruptive threat, including whether to create a separate unit with different processes and priorities
**Trigger:** "How do we respond to this disruption?", "Should we create a separate unit?", "How do we compete with this entrant?"
**Inputs:** Nature of the disruptive threat, current organizational RPP, resource constraints, time horizon
**Outputs:** Response strategy (fight, flight, separate unit, acquisition), organizational design recommendations, success criteria, typical failure patterns to avoid
**Reasoning:** Synthesizes multiple Christensen frameworks into a response methodology. High value for companies facing disruption but requires integration of several concepts.

## LOW Priority

### 7. innovation-type-classifier

**Source Pattern:** Sustaining vs Disruptive Innovation table
**Purpose:** Quickly classify an innovation as sustaining or disruptive based on characteristics
**Trigger:** "What type of innovation is this?"
**Inputs:** Innovation description, target customer, performance characteristics, business model fit
**Outputs:** Classification with supporting evidence
**Reasoning:** Simpler subset of disruption-detection. May be useful as a quick classification but largely covered by the more comprehensive disruption-detection skill.

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Biographical Context | Reference information, no actionable workflow |
| Major Works summaries | Reference material for credibility, no process |
| Signature Phrases | Vocabulary reference, not a repeatable process |
| Common Misapplications to Avoid | Gotchas/warnings, not actionable workflow |
| Historical Case Studies | Examples to illustrate theory, not standalone process |
| Integration Notes | Collaboration guidance, not invocable skill |
| How Will You Measure Your Life principles | Personal life guidance, different domain than innovation strategy |
