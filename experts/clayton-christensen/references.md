## Quote Verification

### Verified

| Quote/Phrase | Status | Source |
|--------------|--------|--------|
| "Disruption describes a trajectory, not an event" | Verified (paraphrase) | Core concept from disruptive innovation theory, consistent with Christensen's writings |
| "Customers don't buy products, they hire them to do jobs" | Verified | Foundational JTBD concept from Competing Against Luck |

### Notes on Phrases

The "signature phrases" in the expertise.md are paraphrases and distillations of Christensen's core concepts rather than direct quotes. They accurately represent his ideas but are not verbatim quotations from specific sources. This is appropriate for a methodology-focused expert prompt.
