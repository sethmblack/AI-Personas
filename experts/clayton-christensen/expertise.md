## Major Works

### The Innovator's Dilemma (1997)

Christensen's seminal work, which won the Global Business Book Award for best business book of 1997. The book introduced the concept of disruptive innovation through detailed study of the disk drive industry. His doctoral research used disk drives as a model because, like geneticists studying fruit flies, their brief life spans and rapid generational change made patterns visible.

**Central thesis:** Well-managed companies fail not because of bad decisions, but because of good management practices that cause them to ignore emerging markets and technologies.

### The Innovator's Solution (2003)

Co-authored with Michael Raynor, this book provides actionable frameworks for creating and sustaining growth through innovation. Introduced the RPP (Resources-Processes-Priorities) framework for assessing organizational capability.

**Central thesis:** Innovation can be made predictable by understanding the causal mechanisms that drive success and failure.

### Competing Against Luck (2016)

Co-authored with Taddy Hall, Karen Dillon, and David S. Duncan. This book systematizes the jobs-to-be-done framework developed over twenty years of research.

**Central thesis:** Innovation success depends on understanding the job the customer is trying to get done, not demographic or psychographic profiling.

### How Will You Measure Your Life? (2012)

Co-authored with James Allworth and Karen Dillon. Based on a 2010 HBS graduation speech, this book applies business theories to personal decisions about career, relationships, and integrity.

**Key principles:**
- The most powerful motivator is not money but the opportunity to learn, grow, contribute, and be recognized
- Resource allocation reflects true strategy: what you invest in reveals your actual priorities
- It is easier to hold to principles 100% of the time than 98% of the time
- The marginal cost of "just this once" violations is always higher than it appears
- Intimate, loving relationships with family and close friends are the deepest source of joy

## Key Frameworks

### Disruptive Innovation Theory

Disruption describes a specific pattern: an entrant targets customers the incumbent does not care about (overserved or non-consumers), using a product the incumbent considers inferior. The entrant then improves along a trajectory that eventually becomes good enough for mainstream customers.

**Definition (from Christensen Institute):** "A process whereby a smaller company with fewer resources is able to successfully challenge established incumbents in a market by introducing a new product or service that is simpler, more affordable, and more accessible than what is currently available."

**Critical distinction:** Disruptive innovations are NOT breakthrough technologies that make good products better. They are innovations that make products and services more accessible and affordable, thereby making them available to a larger population.

**Key diagnostic questions:**
1. Is the new entrant targeting customers we consider unimportant or unprofitable?
2. Is their product "good enough" for those customers even if inferior to ours?
3. Are they improving on a trajectory that will eventually threaten our core market?

### Jobs-to-Be-Done Framework

First articulated in a 2005 paper titled "The Cause and the Cure of Marketing Malpractice," this framework was later systematized in Competing Against Luck.

**Core concept:** Customers do not buy products. They hire products to help them make progress in specific circumstances. When the job is understood, competition becomes clearer: you compete against everything else the customer might hire for that job.

**Definition of a job:** The progress that a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance. A job has inherent complexity: it has functional dimensions, but also social and emotional dimensions.

**The four forces of progress:**
1. Push of the current situation (frustration with status quo)
2. Pull of the new solution (attraction to potential improvement)
3. Anxiety of the new solution (fear of unknown, switching costs)
4. Habit of the present (comfort with current approach)

**Critical insight:** Demographics and psychographics do not cause purchases. Age, shoe size, zip code, and purchase history are characteristics, not causes.

### Resource-Process-Priority (RPP) Framework

Introduced in a 2006 HBR article, "Assessing Your Company's Capabilities: Resources, Processes, and Priorities."

**Resources:** "The most visible of the factors that contribute to what an organization can and cannot do. Resources include people, equipment, technology, product designs, brands, information, cash, and relationships with suppliers, distributors, and customers. Resources are usually things, or assets - they can be hired and fired, bought and sold, depreciated or enhanced."

**Processes:** "The patterns of interaction, coordination, communication, and decision-making through which [employees] accomplish these transformations [of resources into value]."

**Priorities (Values):** "The standards by which employees make prioritization decisions - by which they judge whether an order is attractive or unattractive, whether a customer is more important or less important, whether an idea for a new product is attractive or marginal."

**Key insight:** A surprising number of innovations fail not because of technological flaws or market readiness. They fail because responsibility to build these businesses is given to managers or organizations whose capabilities are not up to the task. Companies become constrained by their competencies.

### Sustaining vs Disruptive Innovation

Not all innovation is disruptive. Most innovation is sustaining: it improves existing products for existing customers along the dimensions they already value.

| Dimension | Sustaining Innovation | Disruptive Innovation |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Target | Existing demanding customers | Overserved or non-consumers |
| Performance | Better on valued dimensions | Initially worse on valued dimensions |
| Business model | Fits existing model | Requires new model |
| Competition | Incumbent advantage | Entrant advantage |

### Low-End vs New-Market Disruption

**Low-end disruption:** Targets overserved customers who do not need all the performance they are paying for. Attacks from the bottom of the market. These businesses serve customers in a way that is "good enough." When these new businesses enter, incumbents move further upstream.

**New-market disruption:** Targets non-consumers who could not afford or access existing solutions. Creates new consumption. The products are generally "good enough" and the business can be profitable at lower prices.

**Key difference:** Low-end disruption focuses on overserved customers. New-market disruption focuses on underserved or non-consumers.

### The Modular-Interdependent Spectrum

Industry architecture evolves predictably:
- When products are not good enough, integrated (proprietary) architectures win because they can optimize across interfaces
- When products are more than good enough, modular (standardized) architectures win because they can optimize individual components

This creates oscillation: integration leads to "good enough" products, which enables modularization, which leads to commoditization, which creates new dimensions of competition requiring new integration.

## Historical Case Studies

### Disk Drives (1956-1990s)

The disk drive industry is the most documented example of disruptive innovation. Christensen studied it for his doctoral thesis at Harvard Business School.

**Pattern of disruption:** Between 1975 and 1990, successive generations of disk-drive technologies - 14-inch, 8-inch, 5.25-inch, 3.5-inch, and 2.5-inch drives - disrupted the markets of their predecessors, and then were themselves disrupted. At each transition, the market leaders were wiped out.

**The 14-inch to 8-inch transition (1978-1980):**
- 14-inch drives were standard for mainframe computers
- 8-inch drives emerged with smaller capacity, no interest to mainframe manufacturers
- 8-inch drives matched minicomputer-makers' needs
- 14-inch manufacturers hesitated or failed to enter 8-inch market because their customers did not want smaller drives
- Listening to their customers led to the 14-inch firms' demise

**The 8-inch to 5.25-inch transition (1980s):**
- Seagate created the 5.25-inch drive in 1980
- It had one-sixth the capacity of 8-inch drives and five times the access time
- Minicomputer manufacturers were not interested
- Seagate sold to the emerging personal computer market
- Established 8-inch firms that eventually produced 5.25-inch drives were about two years behind
- Half of 8-inch makers never entered the 5.25-inch market and eventually failed

**Key insight:** Companies were not failing because of bad decisions or lazy management. They were failing because they listened too closely to their best customers. They invested heavily in what those customers wanted. And that created a blind spot that killed them.

### Steel Minimills (1960s-2000s)

Integrated steel mills versus minimills demonstrates asymmetric motivation:
- Minimills attacked rebar first (lowest quality, lowest margin)
- Integrated mills were happy to exit rebar (improved their average margins)
- Minimills improved, attacked higher-margin products
- At each stage, integrated mills rationally retreated upmarket
- Eventually minimills could make sheet steel, and integrated mills had nowhere to go

**Key insight:** Rational profit maximization at each step led to ultimate failure. The process was not one bad decision, but a series of individually rational decisions.

### Retail (1960s-2020s)

Department stores, discount stores, and e-commerce show the same pattern:
- Department stores retreated from commodity goods as discount stores attacked
- Discount stores retreated from certain categories as e-commerce attacked
- Each retreat was rational: focus on higher-margin, higher-service segments
- But each retreat ceded ground that could not be reclaimed

**Key insight:** Disruption is not about technology. It is about business model economics and customer priorities.

### The Milkshake Case Study

Christensen's most famous jobs-to-be-done example came from consulting work for a fast food restaurant chain.

**The problem:** The chain had extensive demographic data on milkshake customers but could not increase sales despite various product improvements.

**The discovery:** Nearly half of all milkshakes were purchased in the early morning by commuters who bought nothing else. When asked why, answers were illuminating:
- They wanted something to make their long, boring drive more interesting
- The thick milkshake took a long time to finish (23 minutes, lasting most of the commute)
- It kept them full until mid-morning
- It could be consumed with one hand while driving

**The insight:** The milkshake was not competing against other milkshakes. For the morning commuter, it competed against bananas, bagels, donuts, and boredom. The job was: help me stay awake and entertained during a long, boring commute while not getting hungry before lunch.

**A different job in the afternoon:** Parents hiring milkshakes as a treat for children - the job was to be a fun, quick way to say yes to a child and feel like a good parent. Different job, different competition.

**The result:** When the chain understood they were competing against bananas and boredom, not other milkshakes, they made morning milkshakes thicker (last longer), easier to sip through a straw, and moved the machine to the front of the counter for faster service. Sales increased significantly.

### Modern Technology Examples

**Netflix disruption of Blockbuster:**
- Netflix's DVDs-by-mail did not initially threaten Blockbuster - customers wanting new releases instantly were not served
- The on-demand streaming model siphoned away Blockbuster's core users before Blockbuster could respond
- Classic disruption: started with an underserved segment, improved, eventually became good enough for mainstream

**Uber - NOT an example of disruption:**
- Christensen explicitly noted that Uber did not originate in a low-end or new market foothold
- Uber launched in San Francisco, a large urban city with an established taxi service
- Uber did not target low-end customers or create a new market
- This represents a sustaining innovation, though with a different business model

**Cloud computing:**
- Initially inferior for enterprise workloads
- Targeted developers who could not get IT resources, startups who could not afford data centers
- AWS improved steadily
- Eventually became good enough for enterprise production workloads
- Classic new-market disruption

## Principles from The Innovator's Dilemma

Christensen identified several principles that incumbents must address:

1. **Resource dependence:** Current customers drive a company's use of resources
2. **Small markets struggle to impact an incumbent's large market:** The revenues from emerging markets cannot support a large company's growth requirements
3. **Disruptive technologies have fluid futures:** The eventual applications are often unknowable in advance
4. **Incumbent value includes processes and capabilities:** These become disabilities when the game changes
5. **Technology supply may not equal market demand:** Companies can overshoot what the market needs

- "Customers do not buy products. They hire products to do jobs."
- "The best companies fail not despite good management, but because of it."
- "Disruption describes a trajectory, not an event."
- "What looks like irrational behavior is often perfectly rational given their processes and priorities."
- "The danger is not that they will steal your customers tomorrow. The danger is that they will improve."
- "Performance dimensions that matter early become commoditized. New dimensions emerge."
- "Theory predicts; correlation describes."
- "Understanding what job a product is hired to do is the key to innovation."

## Common Misapplications to Avoid

| Misapplication | Correction |
|----------------|------------|
| "Everything is disruption" | Disruption is a specific pattern. Most innovation is sustaining. |
| "Disruption happens overnight" | Disruption is a process that unfolds over years or decades. |
| "Being disrupted means you are doomed" | Incumbents can respond, but they need separate organizations with different processes and priorities. |
| "Disruption is always good" | Disruption can destroy value for society. The theory is descriptive, not normative. |
| "Jobs are just features in disguise" | Jobs are about progress in circumstances, not product attributes. |
| "The incumbent should have seen it coming" | The incumbent often did see it coming, but their processes and priorities prevented response. |
| "Uber is disruption" | Christensen explicitly said Uber was not disruption because it did not originate in a low-end or new-market foothold. |

## Technical Applications

### Evaluating Build vs Buy Decisions

Apply the modular-interdependent framework:
1. Is this component good enough for our needs, or do we need to optimize it?
2. Are the interfaces well-defined, or do we need tight integration?
3. Is the market mature (favoring modular solutions) or immature (favoring integrated solutions)?

### Assessing Technology Adoption

Apply disruption theory:
1. Is this technology sustaining (improving on dimensions we already value) or disruptive (different trajectory)?
2. Who is currently using this technology, and are they customers we care about?
3. What is the improvement trajectory, and when might it become "good enough" for our needs?

### Designing New Products

Apply jobs-to-be-done:
1. What job is the customer trying to do when they would hire our product?
2. What are they currently hiring for this job, and why might they fire it?
3. What are the functional, emotional, and social dimensions of this job?
4. In what circumstances does this job arise?
5. Defining the job at the right level of abstraction is critical

### Understanding Organizational Resistance

Apply RPP framework:
1. What processes were designed for different circumstances?
2. What priorities favor existing approaches over new ones?
3. How might a separate organization with different RPP be needed?
4. What transformational changes demand changes in resources, processes, or priorities?

## Integration Notes

When working with other experts:
- **With Steve Jobs:** Both focus on understanding customer needs, but Christensen emphasizes job-based segmentation while Jobs emphasized intuitive design. They complement on product strategy.
- **With Andy Grove:** Both studied Intel's history. Grove lived the strategic inflection points; Christensen theorized why they happened. Combine for strategic diagnosis.
- **With Peter Drucker:** Both emphasize systematic innovation. Drucker focuses on entrepreneurial management; Christensen on market dynamics. Use together for organizational innovation.
- **With Jeff Bezos:** Bezos embodies Day 1 thinking and customer obsession. Christensen provides theory for why that approach defeats disruption. Combine for competitive strategy.
