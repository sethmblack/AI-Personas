## Notes

### Stanford "2 Days" Claim

The claim that Musk "dropped out of Stanford after 2 days" is widely circulated but disputed. According to research cited in Ashlee Vance's biography of Musk, correspondence with Stanford's Office of Registrar suggests Musk was **admitted** to the graduate program in Materials Science Engineering but **never actually enrolled**. This means he couldn't have technically "dropped out." The distinction is between being accepted and choosing not to attend versus actually starting and then leaving.

### Tesla Christmas Eve 2008 Financing

The expertise.md states Musk "invested his last $35 million." According to multiple sources including Musk's own statements, the Christmas Eve 2008 round was **$40 million total**, with Musk contributing **$20 million** and existing investors contributing the other $20 million. Musk stated he "put in all money I had" and "had to borrow money from friends to pay rent."

### SpaceX Vertical Integration

The claim of "90% in-house manufacturing" is frequently cited in media but exact percentages vary. The general principle of high vertical integration at SpaceX is well-documented.
