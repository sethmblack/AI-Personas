## HIGH Priority (Score 40+)

### 1. first-principles-analysis

**Score:** 48/50

**Source Pattern:** First Principles Thinking
**Purpose:** Break down any problem to its fundamental truths and reason up from there, bypassing conventional wisdom and analogical thinking.
**Trigger:** "Break this down to first principles" or "What's actually true here?" or "Why does everyone assume X?"
**Inputs:** Problem statement, current assumptions, conventional approach being questioned
**Outputs:** List of fundamental truths, identification of false assumptions, novel solution path built from fundamentals

**Reasoning:** This is Musk's signature methodology—the core of his approach to every "impossible" problem. It's highly actionable with a clear 3-step process, has natural trigger phrases, and applies across engineering, business, and personal decision-making. It transforms how people approach seemingly intractable problems.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 3 explicit steps (identify assumptions, find fundamental truths, reason upward)
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases exist
- Scoped: YES - one responsibility (decomposition and reconstruction of problems)
- Reusable: YES - applies to product design, cost reduction, strategy, personal decisions
- Valuable: YES - enables breakthrough thinking on stuck problems

### 2. five-step-algorithm

**Score:** 46/50

**Source Pattern:** The 5-Step Algorithm
**Purpose:** Systematically improve any product, process, or system by following a strict sequence: question requirements, delete, simplify, accelerate, automate.
**Trigger:** "Optimize this process" or "Apply the algorithm" or "How do I make this more efficient?"
**Inputs:** Description of current process/product, goals, constraints
**Outputs:** Specific recommendations for each of 5 steps, ordered action plan, warning about common mistakes

**Reasoning:** This is Musk's distilled manufacturing wisdom, explicitly called "the algorithm" at SpaceX and Tesla. The strict ordering is critical and non-obvious—most people start with automation. Saves massive time by preventing optimization of things that should be deleted.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 5 explicit steps in required order
- Invocable: YES - distinctive trigger ("apply the algorithm")
- Scoped: YES - process/product improvement only
- Reusable: YES - manufacturing, software, business processes, personal productivity
- Valuable: YES - prevents the most common optimization mistakes

### 3. idiot-index-analysis

**Score:** 44/50

**Source Pattern:** The Idiot Index
**Purpose:** Calculate the ratio of final cost to raw material cost to identify cost reduction opportunities and assess manufacturing efficiency.
**Trigger:** "What's the idiot index?" or "How much room is there to reduce cost?" or "Is this price fundamentally justified?"
**Inputs:** Final product cost, raw material cost (or bill of materials)
**Outputs:** Idiot index ratio, interpretation, assessment of cost reduction potential, next steps

**Reasoning:** Simple, powerful metric that immediately reveals whether a price reflects physics or inefficiency. Highly actionable (just calculate), unique trigger phrase, applies to any manufactured good. Provides instant clarity on whether cost reduction is possible.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - single calculation with clear interpretation guide
- Invocable: YES - "idiot index" is distinctive
- Scoped: YES - cost analysis only
- Reusable: YES - any manufactured product or component
- Valuable: YES - instantly reveals cost reduction opportunity size

### 4. physics-limit-analysis

**Score:** 42/50

**Source Pattern:** Physics Limit Analysis / Physics vs. Policy Framework
**Purpose:** Determine whether a constraint is fundamental (physics) or artificial (policy/process/convention), and calculate the gap between current state and theoretical limit.
**Trigger:** "Is this actually impossible?" or "What's the physics limit?" or "Is this physics or is this policy?"
**Inputs:** Current constraint or "impossible" claim, technical parameters of the problem
**Outputs:** Categorization (physics/engineering/process/policy), theoretical limit calculation, gap analysis, assessment of achievability

**Reasoning:** Musk's framework for separating real constraints from artificial ones. Critical for tackling "impossible" problems. Clear categories and decision process. Applies whenever someone claims something can't be done.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 4 constraint categories, gap calculation methodology
- Invocable: YES - "physics or policy" is a natural question
- Scoped: YES - constraint analysis and feasibility
- Reusable: YES - engineering, business strategy, policy analysis
- Valuable: YES - unlocks problems others abandon prematurely

## MEDIUM Priority (Score 30-39)

### 5. vertical-integration-assessment

**Score:** 36/50

**Source Pattern:** Vertical Integration
**Purpose:** Assess whether to make vs. buy a component or capability, based on iteration speed, strategic importance, and supplier dependency.
**Trigger:** "Should we build this or buy it?" or "Should we bring this in-house?" or "Why are we dependent on this supplier?"
**Inputs:** Component/capability in question, iteration speed requirements, strategic importance, current supplier relationship
**Outputs:** Make/buy recommendation with rationale, risk assessment, implementation considerations

**Reasoning:** Important strategic framework but less unique to Musk than his other methods. Useful for any manufacturing or software company making build/buy decisions. Includes Musk's specific criteria (iteration speed, urgency alignment).

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear decision criteria and framework
- Invocable: YES - standard "build vs. buy" trigger
- Scoped: YES - sourcing decisions
- Reusable: YES - manufacturing, software, services
- Valuable: MODERATE - useful but not breakthrough insight

### 6. timeline-compression

**Score:** 34/50

**Source Pattern:** The Urgency Framework / Timeline Compression
**Purpose:** Challenge default timelines by categorizing blockers and identifying which constraints can be eliminated.
**Trigger:** "Why can't this be done faster?" or "What's actually blocking us?" or "Compress this timeline"
**Inputs:** Current timeline, stated blockers/dependencies
**Outputs:** Categorized blockers (physics/engineering/process/policy), which can be eliminated, compressed timeline proposal

**Reasoning:** Useful application of Musk's urgency mindset. Overlaps significantly with physics-limit-analysis but focused specifically on timelines. Practical for project management and planning.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - blocker categorization process
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases
- Scoped: YES - timeline/schedule analysis
- Reusable: YES - any project planning context
- Valuable: MODERATE - derivative of physics-limit-analysis

### 7. manufacturing-innovation-assessment

**Score:** 32/50

**Source Pattern:** The Machine That Builds the Machine
**Purpose:** Evaluate manufacturing processes for innovation opportunities, focusing on part consolidation, cycle time, and factory-level thinking.
**Trigger:** "How do we improve manufacturing?" or "What's the factory innovation opportunity?"
**Inputs:** Current manufacturing process, part count, cycle times, major cost drivers
**Outputs:** Part consolidation opportunities, cycle time improvements, factory-level recommendations

**Reasoning:** Important Musk insight but more specialized than other frameworks. Primarily applicable to hardware manufacturing. Valuable for manufacturing companies but narrower scope.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific improvement categories
- Invocable: YES - manufacturing context triggers
- Scoped: YES - manufacturing process improvement
- Reusable: MODERATE - mainly hardware manufacturing
- Valuable: MODERATE - specialized application
