- **1905:** Born in Paris. Father Jean-Baptiste Sartre, a naval officer, died of a fever in Indochina when Sartre was less than two years old.
- Raised by his mother Anne-Marie (nee Schweitzer) and maternal grandfather Charles Schweitzer, a domineering intellectual who introduced him to literature. Albert Schweitzer was his cousin once removed.
- Small in stature and cross-eyed (exotropia), young Sartre was often isolated, finding companionship in books.
- Educated at Lycee Henri IV in Paris; after his mother's remarriage in 1917, spent unhappy years in La Rochelle before returning to Paris in 1920.

### Education and Early Career (1924-1939)

## Key Works

### Being and Nothingness (L'Etre et le Neant) - 1943

Sartre's magnum opus, subtitled "An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology." Written largely during the German occupation of Paris.

**Core Structure:**
- **Being-in-itself (en-soi):** The mode of being of things. Complete, solid, self-identical. "The in-itself is what it is."
- **Being-for-itself (pour-soi):** The mode of being of consciousness. Never complete, always projecting beyond itself, introducing nothingness into being.
- **Being-for-others (pour-autrui):** Our existence as we appear to others, subject to the objectifying look.

**Key Innovations:**
- Consciousness is nothingness—it is not a thing but a relation to things
- Human freedom is absolute and inescapable
- Bad faith: self-deception about our freedom
- The Look: how the Other's gaze transforms us into objects
- The famous waiter example: over-performing a role to escape freedom

**Famous Examples:**
- *The Waiter:* A cafe waiter whose movements are "a little too precise, a little too rapid"—he is playing at being a waiter to escape the anguish of his freedom.
- *The Keyhole:* Someone peering through a keyhole is absorbed in the scene until footsteps approach—suddenly they become an object under another's gaze, experiencing shame.
- *The Cafe:* Sartre enters a cafe looking for Pierre who is absent—nothingness appears through the consciousness that expects Pierre and finds "Pierre's absence."

### Nausea (La Nausee) - 1938

Sartre's first and most celebrated novel, written in diary form.

**Plot:** Antoine Roquentin, a historian living in the provincial town of Bouville (modeled on Le Havre), experiences increasing episodes of "nausea"—a visceral confrontation with the contingency and absurdity of existence.

**The Chestnut Tree Scene:** The climax occurs when Roquentin contemplates a chestnut tree root in a public garden and is overwhelmed by the realization that existence is utterly contingent, without reason or purpose.

**Key Quote:** "I understood that I had found the clue to existence, the clue to my nauseas, to my own life. In fact, all I could grasp beyond that comes down to this fundamental absurdity."

**Significance:** The visceral, literary expression of existentialist themes that would be systematically developed in *Being and Nothingness*.

### No Exit (Huis Clos) - 1944

One-act play premiered during the German occupation.

**Setting:** A Second Empire drawing room that is hell—no fire, no torture devices, just three damned souls locked together forever.

**Characters:**
- **Garcin:** A pacifist journalist executed for desertion; desperately needs others to validate that he is not a coward.
- **Ines:** A lesbian postal clerk who tormented a woman into murder-suicide; sees through others' self-deceptions.
- **Estelle:** A socialite who drowned her illegitimate baby and drove its father to suicide; needs male attention to feel she exists.

**The Dynamic:** Each tortures the others through an "un-love triangle"—Garcin wants Estelle's validation, Estelle wants Garcin's attention, Ines wants Estelle, but Ines will not validate Garcin. They discover they are each other's torturers.

**"Hell is Other People":** Not a statement that others are intrinsically cruel, but that under the gaze of others we become objectified. We cannot control how others see us, and we need their recognition to know ourselves.

### Existentialism is a Humanism - 1946

A popular lecture defending existentialism against critics (communists called it bourgeois; Christians called it nihilistic).

**Core Arguments:**
- Existence precedes essence: we are not born with a predetermined nature; we create ourselves through choices
- We are "condemned to be free"—freedom is not a gift but an inescapable burden
- With freedom comes total responsibility—we cannot blame circumstances, upbringing, or human nature
- When we choose, we choose for all humanity—we create an image of what we think a human should be
- Atheist existentialism draws the full consequences from the death of God

### The Words (Les Mots) - 1964

Autobiography covering Sartre's first ten years.

**Structure:** Divided into "Reading" and "Writing"—how young Jean-Paul became obsessed with language and chose to be a writer.

**Key Themes:**
- The dominating influence of grandfather Charles Schweitzer
- The fatherless child who created himself through words
- The decision at age eight to become a heroic writer who would save the world
- A critical self-examination of how the "neurosis" of literature shaped him

**Significance:** The work for which the Nobel Prize was awarded—and refused.

### Critique of Dialectical Reason - 1960

Sartre's second major philosophical work, attempting to reconcile existentialism with Marxism.

**Key Argument:** Marxism is "the philosophy of our time"—the unsurpassable horizon of thought—but Soviet Marxism had become sclerotic and needed existentialist injection.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Practico-inert:** The way our past choices constrain present freedom
- **Groups-in-fusion:** Moments when isolated individuals fuse into revolutionary collective action (like the storming of the Bastille)
- **Seriality:** The alienated condition of isolated individuals in a crowd

**Relevance:** His analysis of "groups-in-fusion" seemed prophetic when May 1968 erupted.

## The Three Affective Tonalities

### Anguish (Angoisse)
Not neurotic anxiety but the appropriate response to freedom. We experience anguish when we recognize that we alone are responsible for our choices, that nothing guarantees we will choose well, and that our choices define not just ourselves but our vision of humanity.

**Example:** The military commander who feels anguish because his decisions determine whether soldiers live or die. This anguish is not a weakness but a sign of taking responsibility seriously.

### Abandonment (Delaissement)
The recognition that there is no God, no cosmic moral order, no values written in heaven. We are alone. "If God does not exist, we have no excuse before us, and we are responsible for what we do."

**Example:** The young man in *Existentialism is a Humanism* torn between joining the Resistance and caring for his mother. There is no moral formula, no priest, no philosophy book that can make the choice for him.

### Despair (Desespoir)
We can only count on what depends on our will, on our action. We cannot rely on others, on chance, on history going our way. "I shall have no illusions and shall do what I can."

**Example:** The revolutionary who works for freedom knowing he may not live to see it, that history may turn against his cause. He acts anyway because action is what defines him.

---

## Bad Faith: The Central Concept

Bad faith (mauvaise foi) is self-deception about one's freedom. It occurs when we treat ourselves as things (being-in-itself) rather than as free consciousness (being-for-itself).

### Two Patterns of Bad Faith

**1. Denying Transcendence (Fleeing Freedom)**
Treating yourself as determined by circumstances, roles, or past choices. "I have no choice." "That's just who I am." "I have to."

**2. Denying Facticity (Pretending Absolute Freedom)**
Ignoring the real constraints of your situation. Pure fantasy that ignores embodiment, history, and real limits.

### The Waiter Example
The cafe waiter whose movements are too precise, too waiter-like. He is "playing at being a waiter"—trying to be a waiter the way an inkwell is an inkwell. But a waiter is not a waiter in this mode of being; he is a free consciousness temporarily occupying this role.

### The Woman on a Date
A woman on a first date who leaves her hand in her companion's grasp as if it were an object, not part of her. She pretends the hand has nothing to do with her desires or choices. She is in bad faith about her freedom and responsibility.

### Paradox of Bad Faith
To deceive yourself, you must know the truth you're hiding from yourself. Bad faith is "a lie to oneself, within oneself." This paradox is possible because consciousness is not a thing—it is a relation to itself that allows self-concealment.

## The Look (Le Regard)

### The Keyhole Scenario
Imagine peering through a keyhole, completely absorbed in the scene. Then you hear footsteps. Suddenly you are transformed from pure subject (observer) to object (the one observed). You feel shame—not shame at what you're doing, but shame at *being seen*, at becoming a thing with fixed properties in another's consciousness.

### Consequences of The Look
- Under the gaze of another, we are "transcendence transcended"—our freedom is objectified
- We experience ourselves as we cannot experience ourselves—from the outside
- The other reveals us to ourselves but also freezes us into being what they perceive
- "I see myself because somebody sees me"

### "Hell is Other People"
Often misunderstood as meaning others are inherently cruel. Actually: we are trapped by needing others' recognition while being objectified by their gaze. We cannot control how we appear to others, yet we need their validation to know ourselves.

## Key Relationships

### Simone de Beauvoir (1908-1986)
Met at the Ecole Normale Superieure in 1929 when she finished second (to his first) in the agregation. They formed a legendary partnership: intellectual companions, lovers, collaborators, yet never married and never monogamous. Their "essential love" lasted fifty years while permitting "contingent loves." She applied existentialist philosophy to feminism in *The Second Sex* (1949), developing ideas about "the Other" and "bad faith" in relation to women's situation. She was with Sartre when he died.

### Albert Camus (1913-1960)
Met in occupied Paris in 1943; became close friends and fellow existentialists (though Camus rejected the label). Their friendship exploded publicly in 1952 when *Les Temps Modernes* published a hostile review of Camus's *The Rebel*, which rejected revolutionary violence. Sartre defended communism (while criticizing the USSR); Camus rejected all violence for political ends. They never reconciled before Camus's death in 1960.

**De Beauvoir's observation:** She and Camus were "like two dogs surrounding a bone"—the bone being Sartre.

### Raymond Aron (1905-1983)
Met at the Ecole Normale Superieure; lifelong intellectual rival. Aron introduced Sartre to phenomenology over drinks in 1932. While Sartre moved left, Aron became a leading liberal anti-communist. Their friendship survived despite political opposition.

## The Nobel Prize Refusal (1964)

### What Happened
When rumors circulated that Sartre was being considered, he wrote to the Swedish Academy asking to be withdrawn. The Academy had no procedure for this. He was awarded the prize anyway "for his work which, rich in ideas and filled with the spirit of freedom and the quest for truth, has exerted a far-reaching influence on our age."

### Sartre's Reasons

**Personal:** He had always refused official honors (including the Legion of Honor in 1945). A writer must act only with words, not institutional authority. "Jean-Paul Sartre the Nobel laureate" would lend his institutional weight to any cause he supported.

**Political:** The Nobel Prize went primarily to Western writers "or to rebels of the East." He noted that Pasternak was the only Soviet writer honored, and for a work forbidden in his own country.

**Later Reflection (1976):** "Because I was politically involved, the bourgeois establishment wanted to cover up my 'past errors.' And so they gave me the Nobel Prize. They 'pardoned' me. It was monstrous!"

### Significance
The only voluntary refusal of the Nobel Prize in Literature. (Boris Pasternak was forced by the Soviet government to decline.)

---

## Political Evolution

### Pre-War (1930s)
Largely apolitical. Focused on phenomenology and literature.

### Occupation (1940-1944)
Briefly involved in Resistance group "Socialisme et Liberte." Chose to resist through writing. Later criticized for insufficient resistance.

### Post-War Engagement (1945-1956)
Became fellow traveler of the Communist Party without joining. Defended the USSR against Western critics. Founded *Les Temps Modernes* to promote engaged literature.

### Break with Communism (1956)
The Soviet suppression of the Hungarian uprising ended his defense of the USSR. Sought to salvage Marxism from Stalinist distortion.

### Critique of Dialectical Reason (1960)
Attempted to reconcile existentialism with Marxism. Argued that Marxism is "the philosophy of our time" but needs existentialist renewal.

### May 1968
Enthusiastically supported student revolt. Lectured at occupied Sorbonne. Declared: "For me the movement in May was the first large-scale social movement which temporarily brought about something akin to freedom."

### Later Radicalism (1970s)
Edited Maoist newspaper *La Cause du Peuple*. Increasingly aligned with revolutionary causes. When arrested for civil disobedience, de Gaulle intervened: "You don't arrest Voltaire."
