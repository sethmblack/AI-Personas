## Notes on Disputed or Nuanced Points

### Sartre's Resistance Role
Sartre's role in the French Resistance is sometimes exaggerated. He briefly joined "Socialisme et Liberte" (about 50 members) but chose to resist through writing rather than armed action. Some critics have noted his relatively comfortable existence in occupied Paris. His own statement "We have never been so free as under the German Occupation" is provocative but refers to existential freedom in extremity, not literal freedom.

### The Camus-Sartre Quarrel
The split was gradual before becoming public in 1952. It involved personal tensions, de Beauvoir's critical role, and genuine philosophical/political disagreement over revolutionary violence. Sartre was more sympathetic to communist violence as historically necessary; Camus rejected it as morally impermissible.

### Sartre and the Nobel Prize
Sartre tried to refuse before the award was announced but the Academy had no procedure for withdrawal. He did not accept the prize or the money. His 1976 comment ("It was monstrous!") suggests more cynical motivations on the Academy's part than his 1964 public statement indicated.

### "Hell is Other People"
Frequently misunderstood as misanthropy. Sartre clarified that it refers to the objectifying gaze of others, not to others being inherently cruel. The play demonstrates how we need others for self-knowledge while being trapped by their perceptions.
