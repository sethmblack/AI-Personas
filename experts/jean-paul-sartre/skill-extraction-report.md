## HIGH Priority

### 1. bad-faith-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** Bad Faith (Mauvaise Foi) / The Waiter Example / Two Patterns of Bad Faith
**Purpose:** Diagnose how someone is deceiving themselves about their freedom, either by denying their transcendence (fleeing freedom) or denying their facticity (ignoring real constraints).
**Trigger:** "Am I in bad faith?" or "Why do I feel trapped?" or "I have no choice"
**Inputs:** Description of situation, claimed constraints, sense of being determined or role-bound
**Outputs:** Identification of bad faith pattern (denying transcendence vs. denying facticity), specific self-deceptions exposed, what authentic acknowledgment of freedom would require
**Reasoning:** Central Sartrean concept with clear diagnostic framework. The waiter example and two-pattern structure provide concrete application. Applies to anyone claiming "no choice" or hiding behind roles.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear two-pattern diagnosis, concrete examples, specific prescriptions |
| Invocable | 10 | Natural trigger phrases ("I have no choice," "trapped," "can't change") |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: diagnosing self-deception about freedom |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to career, relationships, identity, any life situation |
| Valuable | 10 | Transforms stuck situations by revealing what freedom is being fled |
| **Total** | **49** | **HIGH** |

### 2. radical-freedom-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Radical Freedom / Facticity vs. Transcendence / Situation
**Purpose:** Analyze what genuine freedom exists within a constrained situation, distinguishing facticity (unchangeable givens) from transcendence (capacity to choose meaning and response).
**Trigger:** "Do I have a choice?" or "What are my real options?" or "Am I actually free here?"
**Inputs:** Description of situation, perceived constraints, desired outcomes
**Outputs:** Two-column analysis (facticity vs. transcendence), assessment of actual freedom, identification of choices being ignored or denied
**Reasoning:** Addresses universal challenge of feeling determined by circumstances. Sartre's distinction between facticity and transcendence provides rigorous framework. Neither pretends freedom is unlimited nor accepts false determinism.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear facticity/transcendence categorization, explicit output format |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers around choice and constraint |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: analyzing freedom within situation |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to any life situation involving perceived constraints |
| Valuable | 10 | Prevents false resignation while acknowledging real limits |
| **Total** | **48** | **HIGH** |

### 3. the-look-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The Look (Le Regard) / Being-for-Others / Keyhole Example
**Purpose:** Analyze how someone's experience is being shaped by the objectifying gaze of others, and how they might reclaim subjectivity.
**Trigger:** "Why do I feel judged?" or "I feel like an object" or "Hell is other people"
**Inputs:** Description of relationship or social situation, sense of being seen/judged, felt loss of agency or identity
**Outputs:** Analysis of the objectifying dynamic, identification of whose "look" is dominating, strategies for reclaiming subject-position
**Reasoning:** Powerful framework for analyzing workplace dynamics, relationships, social anxiety, and any situation where someone feels reduced to others' perceptions. The keyhole example provides vivid illustration.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear subject/object framework, diagnostic process |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers around judgment, objectification |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: analyzing impact of others' gaze |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to relationships, workplace, social situations |
| Valuable | 9 | Illuminates dynamics others miss; path to reclaiming agency |
| **Total** | **46** | **HIGH** |

### 4. existence-essence-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Existence Precedes Essence / Self-Creation / "Man is nothing other than what he makes of himself"
**Purpose:** Challenge appeals to fixed identity, human nature, or predetermined essence by revealing identity as created through choices.
**Trigger:** "That's just who I am" or "It's human nature" or "I can't change my nature"
**Inputs:** Claimed fixed identity or nature, appeals to essence, sense of being determined by "who I am"
**Outputs:** Exposure of the appeal to essence, demonstration that identity is created not discovered, what choices could create a different self
**Reasoning:** Sartre's central claim applied as practical tool. Liberates by showing that what feels essential is actually constructed. Applies to anyone hiding behind fixed identity.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear framework for exposing essence-claims, shows alternatives |
| Invocable | 8 | Triggers around identity and nature; requires recognition |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: challenging fixed-identity claims |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to personal identity, career roles, relationships |
| Valuable | 10 | Fundamentally liberating insight that opens change |
| **Total** | **46** | **HIGH** |

### 5. engaged-decision-framework

**Source Pattern:** Anguish, Abandonment, Despair / Engagement / "When we choose, we choose for all"
**Purpose:** Navigate major decisions with full awareness of freedom, responsibility, and the absence of external guidance—without fleeing into bad faith.
**Trigger:** "What should I commit to?" or "How do I decide without certainty?" or "I'm paralyzed by this choice"
**Inputs:** Decision situation, competing options, desire for external guidance or certainty
**Outputs:** Analysis through anguish (full responsibility), abandonment (no external authority), and despair (only count on your will); identification of what authentic engagement requires
**Reasoning:** Integrates Sartre's three affective tonalities into decision-making framework. Addresses the universal desire for external guidance while demanding authentic engagement.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Three-stage framework; output is orientation not formula |
| Invocable | 8 | Triggers around major decisions, paralysis |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: navigating decisions authentically |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to career, relationships, ethical choices |
| Valuable | 9 | Unique framework that honors difficulty while demanding action |
| **Total** | **43** | **HIGH** |
