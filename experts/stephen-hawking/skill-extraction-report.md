## HIGH Priority

### 1. cosmic-reframe

**Source Pattern:** Cosmic Scale Reframing framework
**Purpose:** Transform narrow, immediate problems by placing them in universal context, revealing what's fundamental versus parochial
**Trigger:** "Give me perspective on this," "Why does this matter?", "I'm stuck in the weeds," or when someone presents a problem without broader context
**Inputs:** Problem statement, current framing, desired outcome (optional)
**Outputs:** Reframed problem with cosmic/universal perspective, identification of fundamental principles at work, renewed sense of significance or appropriate humility
**Reasoning:** Clear 4-step process documented. High reusability across any domain where perspective is needed. Saves significant time in reframing stuck thinking. Directly actionable workflow. Unique to Hawking's methodology - no existing skill covers cosmic-scale perspective shifts.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear 4-step workflow
- Invocable: YES - "Give me perspective on this"
- Scoped: YES - One responsibility: perspective transformation
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any domain
- Valuable: YES - Saves 30+ minutes of stuck thinking
**Decision: CANDIDATE**

### 2. thought-experiment-construction

**Source Pattern:** Thought Experiment Method
**Purpose:** Make abstract technical or scientific concepts tangible by creating vivid mental scenarios the listener can visualize and reason through
**Trigger:** "Help me understand X," "Make this concept tangible," "I need an analogy for...", when explaining complex systems to non-experts
**Inputs:** Abstract concept to illuminate, target audience sophistication level, desired insight
**Outputs:** Vivid scenario with step-by-step walkthrough, counterintuitive conclusion revealed, connection back to technical reality
**Reasoning:** Clear 5-step process. Used extensively in Hawking's work (black hole falling scenarios, North Pole analogy). Distinct from existing `analogy-construction` skill because it creates full scenarios, not just mappings. High value for technical communication.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 5-step documented workflow
- Invocable: YES - "Make this concept tangible"
- Scoped: YES - One responsibility: scenario creation for understanding
- Reusable: YES - Applies across all technical domains
- Valuable: YES - Core communication skill for complex topics
**Decision: CANDIDATE**

### 3. accessibility-audit

**Source Pattern:** The Accessibility Test / One-Equation Rule
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether technical content achieves Hawking-level accessibility - can it reach millions without sacrificing truth?
**Trigger:** "Is this accessible enough?", "Review this for clarity," "Can a non-expert follow this?", before publishing technical documentation
**Inputs:** Technical content to evaluate, target audience, core concept to preserve
**Outputs:** Accessibility score, specific jargon/complexity issues identified, the "one equation" distillation, recommended simplifications that preserve truth
**Reasoning:** Based on the principle that if Hawking explained black holes to 25M readers with one equation, any system can be explained simply. Clear evaluation criteria. Distinct from `simplicity-audit` (which focuses on design) and `clarity-rewrite` (which focuses on prose). This focuses specifically on technical accessibility without truth loss.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear evaluation questions and output format
- Invocable: YES - "Is this accessible enough?"
- Scoped: YES - One responsibility: accessibility evaluation
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any technical communication
- Valuable: YES - Prevents inaccessible documentation, saves revision cycles
**Decision: CANDIDATE**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. paradox-navigation

**Source Pattern:** The Paradox Resolution communication pattern
**Purpose:** Guide someone through an apparent contradiction to deeper understanding, using the paradox as a teaching tool rather than an obstacle
**Trigger:** "This doesn't make sense," "These two things contradict," "How can both be true?", when encountering contradictory requirements or principles
**Inputs:** The apparent paradox/contradiction, context, desired resolution type (acceptance vs. synthesis)
**Outputs:** Articulation of both sides held in tension, path to deeper understanding, insight revealed by wrestling with the paradox
**Reasoning:** Clear 4-step process. Reflects Hawking's approach to information paradox and other fundamental tensions. Distinct from `paradox-craft` (which creates paradoxes for effect). Medium priority because use cases are less frequent than the high-priority skills.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 4-step documented workflow
- Invocable: YES - "Help me resolve this contradiction"
- Scoped: YES - One responsibility: paradox resolution
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any domain with apparent contradictions
- Valuable: YES - Saves time, produces genuine insight
**Decision: CANDIDATE**

## LOW Priority

None identified. The remaining patterns in expertise.md are either reference material (biographical facts, quotes, vocabulary) or already covered by existing skills.

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Entropy and Information Framework | Reference knowledge/mental model, not actionable workflow |
| Build-Up Pattern | Communication style guidance, not invocable workflow |
| Question Cascade | Communication style guidance, too similar to Socratic methods |
| Biographical timeline | Pure reference data |
| Verified quotes | Reference material for authenticity |
| Pop culture appearances | Contextual reference, not actionable |
| Scientific bets | Anecdotes for illustration, not workflow |
| Technical Vocabulary Glossary | Reference lookup, not skill |
| Integration Notes | Coordination guidance, not standalone skill |

| thought-experiment-construction | `analogy-construction` | ~40% | DISTINCT - full scenarios vs. mappings |
| accessibility-audit | `simplicity-audit`, `clarity-rewrite` | ~25% | DISTINCT - technical accessibility focus |
| paradox-navigation | `paradox-craft` | ~20% | DISTINCT - resolution vs. creation |
