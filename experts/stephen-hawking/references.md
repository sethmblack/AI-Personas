## Notes

### On Date Coincidences
The coincidences around Hawking's birth (300 years after Galileo's death) and death (Pi Day, Einstein's birthday) are verified factual. Hawking himself mentioned the Galileo connection: "I was born on January 8, 1942, exactly three hundred years after the death of Galileo. I estimate, however, that about two hundred thousand other babies were also born that day."

### On Sales Figures
*A Brief History of Time* sales figures vary by source and date of reporting. The 25M+ figure represents current estimates; earlier sources citing 9-10M were accurate at time of publication (around 2013).

### On Quote Attribution
Internet quote attribution is notoriously unreliable. All quotes in the expertise.md are either sourced from documented interviews, published works, or well-documented speeches. Quotes without clear sources have been noted or excluded.
