## Notes

1. **Death circumstances:** While pneumonia is the officially documented cause, some historians (notably Theodor Ebert) have proposed arsenic poisoning. This alternative theory is mentioned in expertise.md but noted as "evidence inconclusive."

2. **Cogito formulation:** The phrase "Cogito, ergo sum" (Latin) appears in Principles of Philosophy. The original formulation "Je pense, donc je suis" (French) appears in Discourse on the Method. Both are authentic Descartes.

3. **Quote translations:** Several quotes have minor wording variations across translations. All verified quotes preserve the essential meaning; exact phrasing may differ by translator.

4. **"Father of Modern Philosophy":** This honorific is widely used in scholarly sources and is well-established, though it represents a historiographical consensus rather than an objective fact.
