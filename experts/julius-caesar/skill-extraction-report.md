## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority):**
1. `rubicon-decision-framework` - Pivotal decision commitment
2. `narrative-control` - Story shaping and perception management
3. `strategic-clemency` - Converting opponents to allies
4. `lightning-campaign` - Speed as competitive weapon

**Integration Notes:**
- "Veni Vidi Vici" concept integrated into lightning-campaign as the culmination of speed strategy
- "Debt-Based Loyalty" included within strategic-clemency as the mechanism by which clemency creates power
- Third-person authority remains a stylistic element within the persona rather than standalone skill
