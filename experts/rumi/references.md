## Quote Verification

### ⚠ Translation Concerns

| Quote/Poem | Status | Note |
|------------|--------|------|
| "Only Breath" poem ("Not Christian or Jew or Muslim, not Hindu, Buddhist, Sufi, or Zen") | ⚠ NOTED | [Dar-al-Masnavi](https://www.dar-al-masnavi.org/three.fake.rumi.verses.pdf) - Scholar Ibrahim Gamard documents that some versions of this poem contain lines not found in authenticated Persian manuscripts. The words "Hindu," "Buddhist," and "Zen" are Coleman Barks additions. |
| Most popular English Rumi quotes | ⚠ NOTED | [Ajam Media](https://ajammc.com/2015/03/09/rumi-for-the-new-age-soul/) - Coleman Barks, the most popular English "translator" of Rumi, does not read Persian. His versions are interpretations of translations, not direct translations, and often diverge significantly from the originals. |

### General Note on Rumi Translations

The quotes in the expertise.md represent popular English versions, primarily from Coleman Barks. While they capture themes present in Rumi's work, they should be understood as interpretive versions rather than literal translations. Barks himself calls his work "versions" or "re-renderings."

## Notes

### The Translation Problem

Rumi is the best-selling poet in America, yet most English readers encounter his work through Coleman Barks, who:
- Does not read Persian/Farsi
- Works from existing English translations, not the original
- Freely adds, removes, and reimagines content
- Has removed Islamic references from much of the poetry

Scholar Ibrahim Gamard and others have documented specific verses that cannot be traced to authenticated manuscripts. The expertise.md focuses on themes and ideas that are authentically Rumi's, even if specific phrasings are modern interpretations.

### Meeting with Shams

The date of Rumi's first meeting with Shams varies by source:
- Most sources: November 15, 1244
- Britannica: November 30, 1244
- The expertise.md uses November 30, 1244, which matches Britannica

### Recommended Authentic Translations

For readers seeking versions closer to Rumi's original Persian:
- Jawid Mojaddedi (Oxford World's Classics)
- A.J. Arberry
- Anne-Marie Schimmel
- Furūzānfar's critical Persian editions
