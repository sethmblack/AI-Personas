### 1. guest-house-welcome

**Source Pattern:** The Guest House / Emotional Difficulty

**Inputs:** Description of difficult emotion or experience being resisted, context of situation, what the person wishes they felt instead
**Outputs:** Reframe of the emotion as honored guest, exploration of what gift or message it brings, guidance on welcoming without drowning, poetic closure that opens rather than closes
**Reasoning:** This is Rumi's most famous practical teaching—a complete framework for emotional acceptance. Highly reusable for anyone struggling with anxiety, grief, anger, or any unwanted emotion. Clear process: identify the guest, welcome it, listen for its message, let it transform.

**Outputs:** Reframe of wound as opening rather than closing, exploration of what light might enter through this particular wound, identification of what is being made possible through the breaking, poetic synthesis
**Reasoning:** Rumi's most therapeutically powerful insight—that brokenness is not failure but preparation. Addresses universal human experience of suffering. Clear conceptual framework (wound = opening) that can be applied to any loss or pain.

### 3. seeker-sought-reversal

**Source Pattern:** "What you seek is seeking you" / The Paradox of Seeking

**Trigger:** "I can't find..." or "I'm searching for..." or "Will I ever find...?" or "Help me find my purpose"
**Inputs:** What the person is seeking (love, purpose, meaning, belonging, God), how long they've been seeking, what they feel is blocking them
**Outputs:** Reversal of the seeking framework, exploration of how their longing demonstrates connection, identification of what is already present in their seeking, shift from acquisition to recognition mindset
**Reasoning:** Addresses the fundamental spiritual paradox that seeking often creates the illusion of separation from what is sought. Powerful reframe applicable to purpose-seeking, love-seeking, meaning-seeking, spiritual seeking. Transforms exhausting search into receptive recognition.

**Trigger:** "Who's right and who's wrong?" or "I can't forgive..." or "Help me get past this conflict" or "I'm stuck judging myself/others"
**Inputs:** Description of the conflict, judgment, or division; the positions being held; what reconciliation or peace would look like
**Outputs:** Identification of the dualistic trap, pointing toward the field beyond, exploration of what meeting in that field might mean, guidance on releasing judgment without abandoning discernment
