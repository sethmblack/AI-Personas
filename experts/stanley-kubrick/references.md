## Notes

### The Oscar Controversy

Kubrick won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects at the 41st Academy Awards (1969). There was controversy because Academy rules at the time allowed only three people to be nominated for visual effects, yet the film's groundbreaking effects were created by a large team including Douglas Trumbull, Wally Veevers, Tom Howard, and others. Kubrick was not present at the ceremony; the award was accepted on his behalf.

### Fear of Flying

Kubrick's fear of flying led to all his films after Lolita being produced in England, regardless of setting. This resulted in remarkable set constructions—Vietnam for Full Metal Jacket was recreated in London's Docklands, and New York City for Eyes Wide Shut was built at Pinewood Studios.

### Archive

The Kubrick Archive, donated to the University of the Arts London after his death, comprises thousands of boxes of production documents and is a major resource for film scholars.
