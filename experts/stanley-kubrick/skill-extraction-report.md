## HIGH Priority

### 1. exhaustive-research-methodology

**Source Pattern:** The Kubrick Approach: Research Phase / Exhaustive Research
**Purpose:** Systematically research any subject until you achieve mastery sufficient for confident execution, using Kubrick's card-index and comprehensive documentation methods.
**Trigger:** "How should I research this?" or "I need to deeply understand X" or "Give me a Kubrick-level research plan"
**Inputs:** Subject to research, available time, intended use of research
**Outputs:** Structured research plan with categories, source types, documentation methods, and completion criteria
**Reasoning:** Kubrick's research methodology is his most transferable skill. The Napoleon project exemplifies systematic knowledge accumulation applicable to any field. Clear phases, specific methods (card indexes, primary sources, expert interviews), and a definable endpoint ("could answer any question"). Prevents the common error of insufficient preparation.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific steps and documentation methods
- Invocable: YES - clear trigger phrases for research situations
- Scoped: YES - one responsibility (comprehensive subject research)
- Reusable: YES - applies to any subject requiring deep understanding
- Valuable: YES - transforms superficial into authoritative knowledge

**Score: 48/50**

### 2. visual-composition-analysis

**Source Pattern:** One-Point Perspective / Visual Thinking
**Purpose:** Analyze or design visual compositions using Kubrick's principles of symmetry, one-point perspective, and geometric meaning.
**Trigger:** "How should I compose this?" or "Analyze this visual layout" or "What's the focal point?"
**Inputs:** Visual work (design, photograph, room layout, presentation slide) or description of visual problem
**Outputs:** Analysis of compositional strengths/weaknesses, recommendations for improvement, identification of where the eye is drawn and whether that serves intent
**Reasoning:** Kubrick's visual techniques are highly applicable beyond film: presentations, design, photography, architecture. One-point perspective principles translate to any visual medium. The insight that symmetry creates unease is counterintuitive and valuable. Clear analytical framework.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific compositional principles to apply
- Invocable: YES - natural triggers for design/visual situations
- Scoped: YES - visual composition specifically
- Reusable: YES - presentations, photography, design, architecture
- Valuable: YES - provides framework most people lack for visual analysis

**Score: 45/50**

### 3. iterative-excellence-framework

**Source Pattern:** The Multiple-Take System / Execution Phase
**Purpose:** Structure a process of iteration that pushes past "good enough" to discover what lies beyond obvious solutions, without wasteful repetition.
**Trigger:** "How do I know when something is done?" or "Should I iterate more?" or "Am I being perfectionist or thorough?"
**Inputs:** Work in progress, current quality assessment, time constraints, stakes
**Outputs:** Framework for deciding whether to iterate, what each iteration should seek, and criteria for recognizing completion
**Reasoning:** Kubrick's multiple-take philosophy is often misunderstood as mere perfectionism. The insight is that iteration is discovery, not repetition—each pass reveals something the previous concealed. This framework addresses the universal question of when to stop iterating, providing both "iterate more" and "you're done" criteria.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific criteria and process
- Invocable: YES - common question about iteration/perfectionism
- Scoped: YES - iteration decisions specifically
- Reusable: YES - writing, coding, design, any creative/quality work
- Valuable: YES - solves the perfectionism paralysis problem

**Score: 44/50**

### 4. genre-transmutation-method

**Source Pattern:** Genre and Format / Vision Phase
**Purpose:** Enter any established genre, format, or framework to transcend its conventions and find what it can uniquely express.
**Trigger:** "I'm working in [genre/format]—how do I make it distinctive?" or "How do I avoid being derivative?" or "Give me the Kubrick approach to [genre]"
**Inputs:** The genre/format being used, conventional approaches within it, what you want to express
**Outputs:** Analysis of genre's unique potential, identification of conventions to satisfy vs. transcend, vision for definitive rather than derivative work
**Reasoning:** Kubrick mastered every genre by refusing to merely satisfy conventions. His method—asking what a genre can uniquely express—is applicable to anyone working within established formats. Clear framework for avoiding derivative work while respecting genre strengths.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific questions and analysis structure
- Invocable: YES - anyone working in established genres/formats
- Scoped: YES - genre/format approach specifically
- Reusable: YES - film, writing, music, business presentations, any format
- Valuable: YES - addresses common "derivative work" problem

**Score: 42/50**

### 5. total-control-audit

**Source Pattern:** Total Creative Control / Integration Phase
**Purpose:** Audit any project or system to identify where control has been surrendered to convention, assumption, or neglect—and assess whether that surrender serves or undermines the vision.
**Trigger:** "What am I not controlling that I should be?" or "Audit my project for unexamined assumptions" or "Where have I surrendered control?"
**Inputs:** Project description, decisions made by default vs. deliberately, elements that "just happened"
**Outputs:** List of elements under deliberate control vs. default/convention, assessment of which defaults serve the work and which undermine it, recommendations for reclaiming control where valuable
**Reasoning:** Kubrick's insistence on total control is often seen as megalomania but is actually a quality philosophy: every uncontrolled element introduces randomness into what should be meaning. This skill helps identify where unexamined defaults may be undermining quality.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - systematic audit with clear outputs
- Invocable: YES - project review situations
- Scoped: YES - control/deliberateness audit
- Reusable: YES - any project where quality matters
- Valuable: YES - reveals hidden assumptions and conventions

**Score: 40/50**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 6. preparation-enables-improvisation

**Source Pattern:** The Kubrick Paradox
**Purpose:** Assess whether you have sufficient preparation to improvise confidently, or whether apparent "spontaneity" is actually unprepared guessing.
**Trigger:** "Am I ready to start?" or "Do I know enough to improvise?" or "Preparation vs. paralysis check"
**Inputs:** Intended action, current knowledge state, risks of underprepared execution
**Outputs:** Assessment of readiness (prepared to improvise vs. should research more), specific gaps to fill if not ready, green light if ready
**Reasoning:** The Kubrick paradox—that exhaustive preparation enables rather than prevents improvisation—addresses a common tension between "just start" and "do your research." 3-step assessment: knowledge audit, gap identification, readiness determination.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear readiness assessment
- Invocable: YES - common decision point
- Scoped: YES - preparation sufficiency check
- Reusable: YES - any project start decision
- Valuable: YES - resolves research-vs-action paralysis

**Score: 38/50**

### 7. chess-thinking-for-decisions

**Source Pattern:** Chess and Strategic Thinking
**Purpose:** Apply Kubrick's chess-derived principles to decision-making: control initial excitement, think before grabbing, maintain objectivity in trouble.
**Trigger:** "I see an opportunity—should I grab it?" or "Apply chess thinking to this decision" or "I'm excited about this option"
**Inputs:** Opportunity or decision, initial assessment, stakes
**Outputs:** Analysis that separates initial excitement from sound judgment, identification of what you might be missing, recommendation with excitement-adjusted confidence
**Reasoning:** Kubrick explicitly credited chess for teaching him to "control the initial excitement you feel when you see something that looks good." This is a specific decision-making framework applicable to any high-stakes choice.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific mental process
- Invocable: YES - opportunity/decision situations
- Scoped: YES - excitement-checking specifically
- Reusable: YES - investments, career decisions, creative choices
- Valuable: MODERATE - useful but narrow application

**Score: 35/50**
