## HIGH Priority

### 1. core-values-design

**Source Pattern:** The 10 Core Values development process and implementation framework
**Purpose:** Create committable organizational core values through employee input and systematic implementation
**Trigger:** "What should our values be?" or "Our values feel meaningless" or "How do we define culture?" or "Values are just words on the wall"
**Inputs:** Organization context, existing values (if any), employee feedback mechanisms, hiring/firing authority
**Outputs:** Set of 5-10 committable core values with implementation practices (hiring criteria, performance review integration, accountability mechanisms)
**Reasoning:** Clear 5-step process: survey employees for best traits, distill to core values, integrate into hiring (10/10 requirement), integrate into reviews (50%), enable peer accountability. High reuse across any organization. Saves weeks of facilitation. Meets all 5 criteria.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear process (survey, distill, integrate, enforce)
- Invocable: YES - Triggered by values/culture creation requests
- Scoped: YES - Values creation and initial implementation only
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any organization building culture
- Valuable: YES - Saves significant effort, ensures committable outcomes

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

### 2. culture-fit-hiring

**Source Pattern:** Zappos hiring philosophy with 10/10 culture fit requirement and Pay to Quit mechanism
**Purpose:** Design and execute values-based hiring that filters for culture alignment alongside skills
**Trigger:** "How do we hire for culture?" or "Should we hire this person?" or "Culture fit interview" or "We keep hiring people who don't fit"
**Inputs:** Candidate profile, organization's core values, role requirements, interview access
**Outputs:** Culture fit assessment (scored), interview question recommendations, hiring decision framework, onboarding filter mechanisms (like Pay to Quit)
**Reasoning:** Structured approach with interview questions mapped to each value, scoring mechanism (must be 10/10), and commitment filters (The Offer). Highly reusable - every organization hires. Distinct from existing a-player-hiring (which focuses on excellence, not values fit). Saves significant time and reduces mis-hires.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Interview design, scoring, decision framework
- Invocable: YES - Triggered by hiring decisions and interview design
- Scoped: YES - Hiring and initial onboarding filtering only
- Reusable: YES - Every organization hires people
- Valuable: YES - Mis-hires are extremely expensive; this reduces them

### 3. wow-service-design

**Source Pattern:** Zappos customer service philosophy with no scripts, empowerment, and service-as-marketing
**Purpose:** Transform customer service from cost center to brand-building engine through empowerment and WOW moments
**Trigger:** "How do we improve customer service?" or "Customers are not delighted" or "Service feels transactional" or "We want to WOW customers"
**Inputs:** Current service model, customer touchpoints, employee empowerment level, measurement systems
**Outputs:** WOW service design with empowerment framework, measurement changes (customer happiness vs call time), training recommendations, and signature service moment design
**Reasoning:** Clear methodology: remove scripts, remove time limits, train extensively, measure happiness not efficiency, empower to do "whatever it takes." Reusable across service industries. Distinct from efficiency-focused service design. Saves months of service transformation consulting.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear steps for empowerment, measurement, training
- Invocable: YES - Triggered by service improvement requests
- Scoped: YES - Customer-facing service design only
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any service organization
- Valuable: YES - Service differentiation is rare and powerful

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

### 4. happiness-framework-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The Happiness Framework (perceived control, progress, connectedness, meaning)
**Purpose:** Diagnose and improve employee or customer happiness by analyzing four systematic components
**Trigger:** "Employee engagement is low" or "People are unhappy" or "How do we improve morale?" or "Why is turnover high?"
**Inputs:** Organization or team context, current state of each happiness element, employee feedback
**Outputs:** Happiness diagnosis (which elements are deficient), specific interventions for each element, design recommendations
**Reasoning:** Systematic 4-element framework with clear design implications for each: Control (empowerment), Progress (milestones), Connectedness (collision design), Meaning (purpose articulation). Highly reusable for engagement problems. May overlap partially with existing happiness-skill-assessment - needs differentiation.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Diagnose four elements, design interventions
- Invocable: YES - Triggered by engagement/happiness concerns
- Scoped: YES - Happiness diagnosis and design only
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any team or organization
- Valuable: YES - Engagement problems are universal and costly

**Overlap Check:** happiness-skill-assessment exists but appears assessment-focused. This is diagnosis + design. Overlap ~40% - treat as distinct with differentiation.

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. pay-to-quit-filter

**Source Pattern:** The Offer - $2,000 to quit after training
**Purpose:** Design commitment filtering mechanisms that signal organizational values and filter uncommitted employees
**Trigger:** "We have retention problems" or "People stay for wrong reasons" or "How do we test commitment?" or "New hires don't fit"
**Inputs:** Current onboarding process, organizational values, budget for filtering mechanism
**Outputs:** Commitment filter design (amount, timing, messaging), implementation plan, success metrics
**Reasoning:** Clear mechanism design with timing (after training), amount (meaningful but not coercive), and messaging (we want people who choose us). Reusable but narrower - not all organizations can implement. Lower frequency of use than other skills.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Design filter with amount, timing, messaging
- Invocable: YES - Triggered by retention/commitment concerns
- Scoped: YES - Commitment filtering mechanism only
- Reusable: PARTIAL - Many orgs cannot implement financial offers
- Valuable: YES - Powerful signal, but implementation limited

**Decision:** CANDIDATE (MEDIUM due to limited applicability)
