| Domain | CEOs & Business Leaders |

## Key Companies

### LinkExchange (1996-1998)

Co-founded with Sanjay Madan and Ali Partovi while fresh out of Harvard. Built an advertising network for small websites. Sold to Microsoft in 1998 for $265 million.

**The Culture Warning:** Hsieh described the early days as exciting - working around the clock, sleeping under desks, not knowing what day it was. But as they grew beyond 25 people, culture deteriorated. They hired people who were smart and motivated - but motivated by money and resume building, not the mission.

**The Apathy of Success:** When Microsoft made the offer, Hsieh recalled: "We weren't excited. We weren't cheering. We knew the outside world probably thought we were jumping up and down and doing cartwheels, but instead our mood was a strange mix of apathy and relief."

**Key Lesson:** Success without culture leads to unhappiness. Financial success is hollow if you dread going to work at your own company.

### Zappos (1999-2020)

Joined as advisor and investor in 1999 (invested $500,000), became CEO. Transformed from near-zero sales to $1.2 billion valuation in ten years.

**Key milestones:**
| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1999 | Invested in ShoeSite.com (later Zappos) |
| 2000 | Became co-CEO during dot-com crash, nearly ran out of money |
| 2003 | Focused entirely on customer service and culture |
| 2004 | Moved headquarters from San Francisco to Las Vegas |
| 2005 | Introduced 10 core values framework |
| 2009 | Acquired by Amazon for approximately $1.2 billion |
| 2013 | Began holacracy transition |
| 2015 | Made holacracy mandatory, 14% of workforce departed |
| 2020 | Retired as CEO in August |

**Amazon acquisition notes:** Amazon agreed to let Zappos operate independently and maintain its culture. Hsieh stayed as CEO for 11 more years post-acquisition.

### Downtown Project (2012-2020)

$350 million personal investment to revitalize downtown Las Vegas near Zappos headquarters.

**Investment breakdown:**
- $200 million: Real estate (60+ acres)
- $50 million: Small businesses
- $50 million: Tech startups
- $50 million: Arts, education, culture

**The 3 C's Philosophy:** Goal was to accelerate Collisions (chance encounters that spark innovation), Co-learning, and Connectedness. Hsieh believed cities scale better than companies - as cities grow, they become more productive, while companies become less productive.

**Key developments:** Container Park, Fergusons Downtown, acquired 100+ properties.

**Hsieh's Reflection:** "The thing we would have done differently, knowing what we know now, is really made our goals much more explicit. We would have put collisions ahead of co-learning, connectedness, and even return on investment."

## The 10 Core Values

Developed in 2005 by surveying employees about the best characteristics of Zappos employees. Thirty-seven traits were distilled to 10 core values.

| # | Core Value | Essence |
|---|------------|---------|
| 1 | Deliver WOW Through Service | Not good service. WOW. The kind customers tell everyone about. |
| 2 | Embrace and Drive Change | Adapt or become irrelevant |
| 3 | Create Fun and a Little Weirdness | Work should not be boring. Be yourself. |
| 4 | Be Adventurous, Creative, and Open-Minded | Take risks. Best ideas sound crazy first. |
| 5 | Pursue Growth and Learning | Never stop. Personal and professional. |
| 6 | Build Open and Honest Relationships with Communication | No politics. No hidden agendas. |
| 7 | Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit | Treat colleagues like family. |
| 8 | Do More with Less | Constraints breed creativity. |
| 9 | Be Passionate and Determined | Care deeply. Persist through obstacles. |
| 10 | Be Humble | Confidence without arrogance. Always learning. |

### Values Implementation Practices

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 50% of reviews | Half of performance evaluation based on values embodiment |
| 10/10 culture fit | Candidates must score perfect on culture to be hired |
| Values-based termination | Can be fired for values violations regardless of job performance |
| Peer accountability | Employees can call out others for values violations |
| Pay to Quit | $2,000 offered to new hires to quit if culture is not a fit |

## The Happiness Framework

From Delivering Happiness, Hsieh identified four elements of happiness:

| Element | Description | Design Implication |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Perceived Control | Feeling agency over environment and decisions | Empower employees; reduce bureaucracy |
| Perceived Progress | Forward movement matters more than absolute position | Celebrate milestones; make progress visible |
| Connectedness | Quality and quantity of relationships | Design for collisions; build community |
| Vision/Meaning | Being part of something bigger than yourself | Connect work to purpose; articulate why |

**Application:** Design employee experiences to maximize all four. Design customer experiences the same way.

## Customer Service Philosophy

### Core Belief
"Zappos is a customer service company that just happens to sell shoes."

### The No-Script Philosophy

Zappos call center agents have complete autonomy. No scripts. No upselling requirements. No call time limits.

**Training approach:** Four weeks of training before anyone touches a phone. Every employee regardless of role spends time in the Customer Loyalty Team.

**Measurement:** Agents are not measured by how many calls they take, but by how happy customers are at the end.

### Famous Call Records

| Record | Duration | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| Longest call (2012) | 10 hours, 29 minutes | Agent and customer discussed vacations, hometowns, childhoods |
| Later record | 10 hours, 43 minutes | Agent described it as "effortless, like talking to a friend of 20 years" |

### Legendary Service Stories

**The Pizza Call:** Hsieh bet a friend that if he called Zappos customer service asking for late-night pizza delivery, they would help. The agent returned in two minutes with a list of the five closest late-night pizza restaurants.

**Tommy and the Gummy Bear:** Agent Kelli spent nearly two hours with customer Tommy, learned he was in the military ordering shoes for Afghanistan, and learned his nickname was "gummy bear." After shipping his shoes, she sent a care package.

**The Lonely Customer Insight:** Hsieh understood that many customers call not because they are angry, but because they are lonely and want to talk to live people. Service is connection.

### The Phone Number Philosophy

Zappos puts its phone number on every page of its website. Most companies hide their numbers. Zappos invites calls because:
- "The telephone is one of the best branding devices out there"
- Each call is an investment in brand, not an expense to minimize
- Real conversations create real loyalty

## Holacracy Experiment

### What Is Holacracy
A self-management system replacing traditional hierarchy with "circles" - overlapping groups organized around work rather than titles.

### Zappos Implementation Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2013 | Announced holacracy transition |
| 2013-2015 | Phased rollout across departments |
| March 2015 | Hsieh sent company-wide email making holacracy mandatory |
| April 2015 | Offered 3 months severance for those who opted out |
| Result | 14% of workforce departed (including 20% of tech team) |

### Hsieh's Rationale

**The City Metaphor:** Cities scale better than companies. As companies grow, they get less productive per person. As cities grow, they get MORE productive. Holacracy was an attempt to capture city dynamics within a company.

**What he sought:** Self-organization, emergent behavior, fewer top-down controls, employees participating in governance, org chart changing "50 times a day" based on needs.

**His perspective:** "Calling it holacracy was more a way of codifying or making explicit what was already implicit in our culture."

---

## The Culture Book

Zappos publishes an annual Culture Book made up of unedited employee submissions about what company culture means to them.

**Contents:** 100 to 500-word essays written by employees, describing their experience of Zappos culture.

**Distribution:** Given to anyone who wants one - employees, suppliers, clients, the public.

**Purpose:** Authentic documentation of culture from those who live it, not from marketing.

## Integration Notes

When working with other experts:

- **With Steve Jobs:** Both obsessed with company culture, but different approaches. Jobs focused on product excellence; Hsieh on service excellence. Jobs used control; Hsieh used empowerment. Both believed in hiring A-players.

- **With Peter Drucker:** Hsieh operationalized Drucker's insight that "culture eats strategy for breakfast." Where Drucker theorized, Hsieh implemented with measurable systems.

- **With Warren Buffett:** Both value long-term thinking over short-term metrics. Buffett on investment patience; Hsieh on culture patience. Both willing to sacrifice short-term results for long-term positioning.

- **With Simon Sinek:** Hsieh's focus on meaning and purpose aligns with Sinek's "Start With Why." Zappos core values answer the why question for employees.

- **With Marcus Aurelius:** Both valued humility as a core virtue. Hsieh's 10th value (Be Humble) echoes Stoic principles of continuous learning and respect.

- **With Dale Carnegie:** Both understood that business success comes from genuine human connection. Carnegie on influence; Hsieh on customer and employee relationships.
