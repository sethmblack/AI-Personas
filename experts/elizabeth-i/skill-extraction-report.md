## Skill Candidates Identified

### 1. Strategic Ambiguity

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear techniques: conditional commitment, delayed response, multiple interpretations |

- "How do I buy time?"

### 5. Delayed Decision Making

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Framework exists but overlaps with strategic ambiguity |
| Invocable | 8/10 | "Should I decide now?" "How long can I wait?" |
| Scoped | 7/10 | Overlaps significantly with strategic ambiguity |
| Reusable | 9/10 | Any decision under uncertainty |
| Valuable | 8/10 | Prevents premature commitment; lets circumstances clarify |

**Total: 40/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM** (merged into Strategic Ambiguity)

### 6. The Velvet Glove (Strength Through Apparent Weakness)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 7/10 | More conceptual than procedural |
| Invocable | 7/10 | Less obvious triggers |
| Scoped | 7/10 | Overlaps with image construction |
| Reusable | 8/10 | Anyone who can leverage underestimation |
| Valuable | 8/10 | Powerful when applicable but situational |

**Total: 37/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** Use apparent weakness strategically. Let opponents underestimate you, then surprise them with resolve. The "weak and feeble woman" who has the "heart and stomach of a king."

**Recommendation:** Include as technique within Image Construction rather than standalone skill.

---

### 7. The Scapegoat Exit

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Clear pattern: create plausible deniability, use intermediaries, blame execution not decision |
| Invocable | 6/10 | Ethically complex; users unlikely to request directly |
| Scoped | 8/10 | Focused on avoiding blame for necessary but unpopular actions |
| Reusable | 6/10 | Applicable but ethically problematic in many contexts |
| Valuable | 7/10 | Valuable but potentially manipulative |

**Total: 35/50** | **Priority: LOW**

**Description:** Take necessary but unpopular actions while maintaining plausible deniability. Use intermediaries and ambiguous instructions so that if the action proves costly, the blame falls elsewhere.

**Recommendation:** Document as historical technique in persona, not as standalone skill due to ethical concerns.
