## The Religious Settlement of 1559

### The Context

Elizabeth inherited a realm torn by religious conflict. Her father Henry VIII had broken with Rome; her brother Edward VI had pushed toward Protestantism; her sister Mary I had restored Catholicism and burned Protestant martyrs.

### The Via Media (Middle Way)

Elizabeth's religious settlement was deliberately ambiguous:

- **Act of Supremacy (1559):** Revived antipapal statutes; declared Elizabeth "Supreme Governor" (not "Head") of the Church of England - a title acceptable to those uncomfortable with a woman heading the church
- **Act of Uniformity (1559):** Established a revised Book of Common Prayer that could be interpreted both Protestant and Catholic ways
- **Thirty-Nine Articles (1563):** Defined doctrine in deliberately broad terms

### The Strategy

Elizabeth sought to "not make windows into men's hearts and secret thoughts." The settlement:
- Retained Catholic ceremony and episcopal structure
- Embraced Protestant theology
- Required outward conformity while allowing private conscience
- Satisfied most English subjects sufficiently, if none perfectly
- Created the foundation for the Church of England's distinctive identity

## The Cult of Gloriana

### Image as Power

Elizabeth understood that in an age before mass media, controlled imagery was political power. She managed her public image with unprecedented sophistication:

### Portrait Propaganda

- **The Coronation Portrait:** Established her as legitimate heir
- **The Armada Portrait (c. 1588):** Hand resting on globe, storm destroying Spanish ships in background - England's victory personified
- **The Rainbow Portrait (c. 1600-1602):** Eyes and ears on her cloak symbolizing her intelligence network; serpent of wisdom on her sleeve
- **The Mask of Youth:** As she aged, portraits became increasingly stylized, presenting an eternally youthful sovereign

### Symbolic Roles

- **The Virgin Queen:** Married to England, her purity representing the nation's integrity
- **Gloriana:** The Faerie Queene of Spenser's epic, a semi-divine figure
- **Astraea:** The classical goddess of justice returned
- **The Phoenix:** Unique, immortal, self-regenerating

### The Royal Progresses

Elizabeth traveled throughout her realm in elaborate summer progresses:
- Demonstrated royal presence across the kingdom
- Allowed subjects to see their queen in person
- Provided entertainment and patronage to the nobility
- Cost the hosts enormous sums, keeping them financially dependent

## Famous Speeches and Quotations

### Speech to the Troops at Tilbury (August 9, 1588)

Delivered as the Spanish Armada threatened invasion. The text comes primarily from Leonel Sharp's letter written c. 1624:

> "My loving people, We have been persuaded by some that are careful of our safety to take heed how we commit ourselves to armed multitudes, for fear of treachery. But I assure you, I do not desire to live to distrust my faithful and loving people. Let tyrants fear."

> "I know I have the body of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too, and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain, or any prince of Europe, should dare to invade the borders of my realm."

### The Golden Speech (November 30, 1601)

Delivered to her final Parliament, addressing the monopolies crisis:

> "And though God hath raised me high, yet this I account the glory of my crown, that I have reigned with your loves. This makes me that I do not so much rejoice that God hath made me to be a Queen, as to be a Queen over so thankful a people."

> "Though you have had, and may have, many mightier and wiser princes sitting in this seat, yet you never had, nor shall have, any that will love you better."

### On Marriage to England (1559)

From her response to Parliament's petition that she marry:

> "I am already bound unto a husband, which is the Kingdom of England; and that may suffice you... And this shall be for me sufficient: that a marble stone shall declare that a queen, having reigned such a time, lived and died a virgin."

### The Motto: Video et Taceo

"I see, and say nothing" - Elizabeth's personal motto captured her strategic approach. As William Camden recorded: "Which notwithstanding Queene Elizabeth dissembled and concealed with silence, according to that motto which she used, video et taceo."

The motto encompassed:
- Listening and evaluating rather than blindly accepting counsel
- Maintaining strategic silence appropriate to her position
- Preserving options through ambiguity
- The "coiled power that can reside in the silence of the sovereign"

## Key Relationships and Faction Management

### William Cecil, Lord Burghley (1520-1598)

- Principal advisor for nearly 40 years
- Secretary of State (1558-1572), then Lord Treasurer
- Favored cautious, administrative approach
- Managed finances, intelligence, and foreign policy
- Elizabeth called him her "Spirit"

### Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester (1532-1588)

- Elizabeth's closest favorite for 30 years
- Romantic attachment widely rumored but never confirmed
- Often at odds with Cecil on policy (favored intervention in Netherlands)
- Elizabeth grieved deeply at his death

### Sir Francis Walsingham (1532-1590)

- Principal Secretary and spymaster
- Built the intelligence network that uncovered Catholic plots
- Instrumental in gathering evidence against Mary Queen of Scots
- Managed the security of the realm

### Robert Cecil (1563-1612)

- Son of Lord Burghley, groomed for power
- Took over as principal advisor in the 1590s
- Rivaled by the Earl of Essex
- Eventually secured the succession of James VI of Scotland

### Elizabeth's Management Style

Elizabeth maintained control through:
- **Balancing factions:** Neither Cecil nor Leicester ever dominated completely
- **Personal relationships:** Emotional bonds with favorites alongside professional relationships with administrators
- **Strategic uncertainty:** Councillors never knew her true mind, forcing them to compete for her favor
- **Preserving final authority:** She listened to advice but made her own decisions

## The Mary Queen of Scots Question

### The Prisoner Queen

Mary Stuart, Queen of Scotland, arrived in England in 1568 after being forced to abdicate. Elizabeth faced an impossible dilemma:
- Mary was her cousin and a fellow anointed queen
- Mary was Catholic and the focus of plots to replace Elizabeth
- Executing her would set a dangerous precedent
- Not executing her maintained constant danger

### Nineteen Years of Delay

Elizabeth kept Mary imprisoned but alive for 19 years, employing classic strategic ambiguity:
- Refused to try her
- Refused to free her
- Refused to hand her to Scotland
- Explored various diplomatic solutions, none implemented

### The Babington Plot and Execution (1587)

In 1586, Walsingham's agents uncovered the Babington Plot - Mary had agreed to Elizabeth's assassination. Elizabeth finally signed the death warrant on February 1, 1587.

After Mary's execution on February 8, 1587:
- Elizabeth claimed Davison had disobeyed instructions not to dispatch the warrant
- Davison was imprisoned in the Tower, later released
- Elizabeth maintained she never intended the execution to proceed
- She thus avoided full responsibility while eliminating the threat

## Strategic Principles

### The Answer Answerless

Elizabeth's term for responses that appear to address a question while committing to nothing. When Parliament demanded she decide Mary's fate in 1586, she delivered an "answer answerless" - neither agreeing to execution nor refusing it.

### Deliberate Delay

- What seems urgent to petitioners need not be urgent to the sovereign
- Delay reveals intentions and changes circumstances
- Time turns some problems into non-problems
- Early commitment forecloses options

### Conditional Commitment

When forced to appear to agree, attach so many conditions that fulfillment depends on future interpretation.

### The Iron Hand in the Velvet Glove

Elizabeth exploited expectations of feminine weakness:
- Appeared as a "weak and feeble woman" while possessing the "heart and stomach of a king"
- Used vulnerability strategically
- Let opponents underestimate her, then surprised them with resolve
