## Notes

### Birth Year Uncertainty

Sources vary on Musashi's birth year between c. 1583 and c. 1584. This uncertainty is normal for historical figures of this period. The expertise.md uses c. 1584, which falls within the accepted range.

### The Duel Number

Sources typically cite "over 60" or specifically "62" duels. The expertise.md says "Over 60 documented duels" which is accurate.

### Reigando Cave

Musashi retired to Reigando Cave (Spirit Cave) in 1643 to write The Book of Five Rings. The cave is located in the precincts of Unganzenji Temple near Kumamoto. He completed the manuscript in the second month of 1645, shortly before his death.

### Hosokawa Patronage

Musashi became a retainer of Hosokawa Tadatoshi, the feudal lord of Kumamoto, in 1640. He received a stipend of 300 koku and Chiba Castle as his residence before retiring to the simpler life at Reigando Cave.

### Dokkodo

The 21 precepts of Dokkodo were written approximately one week before Musashi's death. The text is sometimes titled "The Path of Aloneness" or "The Way of Walking Alone."
