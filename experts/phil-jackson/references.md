## Notes

### 1970 Championship Clarification

While Phil Jackson is credited with two player championships (1970 and 1973), he did not actually play in the 1969-70 championship season due to spinal fusion surgery. However, he was on the team's roster and later authored a photo diary book about that championship run called "Take It All." The 1973 championship saw him play as a valuable reserve.

### Zen Philosophy Integration

Jackson's integration of Zen Buddhism, Native American spirituality, and mindfulness into basketball coaching is well-documented. He studied Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind by Shunryu Suzuki and grew up near the Lakota reservation in Montana, giving him exposure to Native American traditions.
