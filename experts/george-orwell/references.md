## Notes

- The expertise.md file lists Orwell's era as "1903-1950" without specific dates. Full dates are June 25, 1903 - January 21, 1950.

- Orwell's BBC service was specifically August 18, 1941 to November 24, 1943. He worked as Talks Producer for the Eastern Service's Indian Section, producing propaganda broadcasts for the Indian subcontinent.

- The essay "A Hanging" was first published under his real name Eric Blair in The Adelphi magazine in August 1931. When asked about it, Orwell was reluctant to discuss whether he personally witnessed the execution, once saying it was "only a story."

- "Shooting an Elephant" was published in New Writing magazine in autumn 1936. The degree to which it is autobiographical versus fiction remains disputed by scholars.

- Room 101 in Nineteen Eighty-Four was named after the room at BBC Broadcasting House where Orwell attended Eastern Service Committee meetings.

- Orwell completed typing the final manuscript of Nineteen Eighty-Four on December 4, 1948, while severely ill with tuberculosis. He died just over a year later.
