## Management Philosophy & Style

### Ruthless Prioritization

Sandberg is known for emphasizing ruthless prioritization: "Sometimes people think of prioritization as only doing things that will have a positive impact on your business, but ruthless prioritization means only focusing on the very best ideas. It means figuring out the 10 things on your list and, if you can't do all 10, doing the top two really well."

### Feedback Culture

At Facebook, Sandberg and Zuckerberg established a practice of twice-weekly meetings specifically for honest feedback and working through disagreements. This became a model for how senior executives can maintain alignment while preserving candor.

### Creating Psychological Safety

At Google, Sandberg discovered she had become a bottleneck in hiring decisions, but her team hadn't told her. Her reflection: "I thought to myself, 'I've become a bottleneck and you didn't tell me, and that's on me.' I realized I had to make it safe to speak up when I'm messing up."

### Evolution Over Time

Her leadership style evolved across organizations:
- **At Google:** Heavily analytical and growth-focused, direct, results-oriented
- **At Facebook:** More collaborative, emphasizing employee empowerment, innovation, and risk-taking
- **Post-Option B:** Greater emphasis on emotional resilience, inclusivity, and empathy

### The "Option B" Origin

After Goldberg's death, Sandberg was preparing for a father-child activity and told her friend Phil Kessler: "I want Dave." Kessler replied: "Option A is not available. So let's just kick the shit out of Option B."

This phrase became the foundation for the book she later co-wrote with Adam Grant.

## Key Frameworks & Concepts

### The Lean In Framework

1. **Sit at the Table** - Take your seat; don't defer to others
2. **Make Your Partner a Real Partner** - Equal distribution of home responsibilities
3. **Don't Leave Before You Leave** - Don't pre-emptively scale back career
4. **Find Mentors and Sponsors** - Both provide different value
5. **Seek and Speak Your Truth** - Authentic communication matters
6. **Don't Do It Alone** - Build support networks

### The Three Ps of Resilience (from Option B)

When bad things happen, watch for:
- **Personalization** - Believing it's entirely your fault
- **Pervasiveness** - Believing it affects all areas of life
- **Permanence** - Believing it will last forever

Countering these cognitive distortions speeds recovery.

### Mentorship vs. Sponsorship

**Mentors:**
- Give advice and guidance
- Share wisdom and experience
- Help you develop skills
- Can be at any level
- Act as sounding boards; offer support as requested
- Expect little in return

**Sponsors:**
- Put their reputation on the line for you
- Advocate for you in rooms you're not in
- Push opportunities your way
- Typically senior leaders with organizational influence
- Invest in you because they believe in you
- Expect stellar performance and loyalty in return

**Key Distinction:** "Mentorship is a relatively loose relationship... Sponsors, in contrast, are much more vested in their proteges."

**The Sponsor Effect (Research Data):**
- Women with sponsors are 27% more likely to ask for a raise
- Women with sponsors are 22% more likely to ask for stretch assignments
- Women are 54% less likely than men to have a sponsor
- Sponsor effect quantified at 19% boost to career advancement

**Problem:** Women are often over-mentored and under-sponsored, which limits career advancement.

Both are essential for career advancement, but sponsorship opens doors that advice alone cannot.

### Career Jungle Gym

- Traditional career ladder metaphor is outdated
- Modern careers involve lateral moves, pivots, exploration
- Skill building happens across functions and industries
- The view from the top of a jungle gym is different depending on how you climbed

## Famous Quotes Collection

### On Leaning In

- "We hold ourselves back in ways both big and small, by lacking self-confidence, by not raising our hands, and by pulling back when we should be leaning in."
- "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"
- "In the future, there will be no female leaders. There will just be leaders."
- "Women need to shift from thinking 'I'm not ready to do that' to thinking 'I want to do that - and I'll learn by doing it.'"

### On Fear and Self-Doubt

- "Fear is at the root of so many of the barriers that women face. Fear of not being liked. Fear of making the wrong choice. Fear of drawing negative attention. Fear of overreaching. Fear of being judged. Fear of failure. And the holy trinity of fear: the fear of being a bad mother/wife/daughter."
- "Success and likeability are positively correlated for men and negatively for women. When a man is successful, he is liked by both men and women. When a woman is successful, people of both genders like her less."

### On Learning and Growth

- "The ability to learn is the most important quality a leader can have."
- "Trying to do it all and expecting it all can be done exactly right is a recipe for disappointment. Perfection is the enemy."

### On Career Navigation

- "Careers are a jungle gym, not a ladder."
- "If you're offered a seat at the table, take it. If you're not offered a seat, bring a folding chair."
- "Done is better than perfect."

### On Leadership and Success

- "We cannot change what we are not aware of, and once we are aware, we cannot help but change."
- "Fortune does favor the bold and you'll never know what you're capable of if you don't try."
- "Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence."

### On Resilience

- "Option B is not giving up. It is finding a way forward when Plan A is no longer possible."
- "Resilience is not about having a backbone. It's about strengthening the muscles around our backbone."
- "We find our humanity - our will to live and our ability to love - in our connections to one another."

## Key Statistics & Data Points

### The Confidence Gap

- The widely-cited claim that men apply for jobs at 60% qualification while women wait for 100% originates from an HP internal report referenced in a McKinsey Quarterly article
- Note: This statistic has been questioned by researchers who found the original source to be anecdotal rather than peer-reviewed
- Despite sourcing concerns, the broader pattern of women self-selecting out of opportunities is supported by other research
- Sandberg cites this in Lean In to illustrate the confidence gap phenomenon

### The Likeability Penalty

- Success and likeability are positively correlated for men
- Success and likeability are negatively correlated for women
- This creates a double bind for women advancing in their careers

- Over 4.2 million copies of Lean In sold worldwide
- Over 50,000 Lean In Circles formed globally
