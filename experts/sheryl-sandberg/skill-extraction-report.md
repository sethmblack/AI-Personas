## Evaluation Methodology

Each pattern evaluated against 5 criteria:

- **Invocable** - Could be triggered by a request
- **Scoped** - One responsibility, clear boundaries
- **Reusable** - Applies across multiple contexts
- **Valuable** - Saves significant effort or ensures consistency

## HIGH Priority

### 1. lean-in-career-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Lean In Framework
**Purpose:** Assess current career stance and identify where someone is holding back, then provide actionable recommendations for leaning in
**Trigger:** "Am I holding myself back?", "Why am I not advancing?", "Should I apply for this opportunity?", "I'm not sure I'm ready"
**Inputs:** Current career situation, specific opportunity or challenge, self-assessment of readiness
**Outputs:** Assessment of internal barriers, identification of "holding back" patterns, specific lean-in actions, confidence-building framework

**Criteria Evaluation:**
- Actionable: Yes - Clear 6-principle framework with specific steps
- Invocable: Yes - Natural trigger phrases around career hesitation
- Scoped: Yes - Focused on career advancement decisions
- Reusable: Yes - Applies to any career decision, promotion, opportunity
- Valuable: Yes - Addresses pervasive confidence gap issue

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

**Reasoning:** The Lean In framework has clear, repeatable steps (sit at table, don't leave before you leave, etc.) and addresses a well-documented problem (confidence gap where women wait for 100% qualifications while men apply at 60%). High estimated use frequency for career coaching scenarios.

### 2. resilience-three-ps-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** The Three Ps of Resilience (from Option B)
**Purpose:** Diagnose cognitive distortions after setback and provide framework for faster recovery
**Trigger:** "I can't move past this", "Everything is falling apart", "This is all my fault", "Things will never get better"
**Inputs:** Description of setback or adverse event, current emotional state, specific thoughts about the situation
**Outputs:** Assessment of Personalization, Pervasiveness, Permanence patterns; specific cognitive reframes; recovery action plan

**Criteria Evaluation:**
- Actionable: Yes - Clear 3-part diagnostic framework with specific interventions
- Invocable: Yes - Natural trigger phrases around setbacks and grief
- Scoped: Yes - Focused specifically on cognitive distortions after adversity
- Reusable: Yes - Applies to any setback (career, personal, loss)
- Valuable: Yes - Based on psychological research; speeds recovery

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

**Reasoning:** The Three Ps framework is a psychologically-grounded diagnostic tool that can be applied systematically to any adverse situation. Clear inputs (situation + thoughts) and outputs (diagnosis + reframes). High value for resilience coaching.

### 3. mentor-sponsor-gap-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Mentorship vs. Sponsorship Framework
**Purpose:** Analyze current support network to identify gaps between mentorship and sponsorship, then provide strategy for acquiring sponsors
**Trigger:** "I have mentors but I'm not advancing", "How do I find a sponsor?", "What's the difference between mentor and sponsor?", "I need someone to advocate for me"
**Inputs:** Current mentor relationships, career advancement goals, organizational context
**Outputs:** Mentor/sponsor gap analysis, sponsor identification strategy, relationship cultivation plan, sponsor acquisition roadmap

**Criteria Evaluation:**
- Actionable: Yes - Clear distinction with actionable differences; strategy for finding sponsors
- Invocable: Yes - Common career development question
- Scoped: Yes - Focused on mentor/sponsor network building
- Reusable: Yes - Applies at any career stage, any organization
- Valuable: Yes - Addresses critical gap (women 54% less likely to have sponsors); quantified 19% career boost

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

**Reasoning:** The mentor/sponsor distinction is one of Sandberg's most cited contributions. Clear actionable framework with strong research backing (27% more likely to ask for raise with sponsor). Addresses specific, measurable problem.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. career-jungle-gym-mapping

**Source Pattern:** Career Jungle Gym
**Purpose:** Map non-linear career options and evaluate lateral moves for skill building
**Trigger:** "Should I take this lateral move?", "My career isn't progressing linearly", "I want to try something different", "What skills should I build?"
**Inputs:** Current role, career aspirations, available opportunities (including lateral moves)
**Outputs:** Career option map, skill gap analysis, lateral move evaluation, non-linear path strategy

**Criteria Evaluation:**
- Actionable: Yes - Provides alternative framework for evaluating moves
- Invocable: Yes - Triggered by career transition questions
- Scoped: Yes - Focused on non-linear career planning
- Reusable: Yes - Applies to any career transition decision
- Valuable: Moderate - Useful reframe but less structured than other frameworks

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

### 5. difficult-conversation-framework

**Source Pattern:** Difficult Conversations (How You Lead section)
**Purpose:** Structure and deliver difficult feedback or conversations using Sandberg's fact-based, impact-focused approach
**Trigger:** "I need to give hard feedback", "How do I have a difficult conversation?", "I need to address a performance issue"
**Inputs:** Specific observation/behavior, impact of behavior, desired outcome
**Outputs:** Structured conversation plan, opening statement, impact framing, collaborative solution process

**Criteria Evaluation:**

- Scoped: Yes - Focused on difficult feedback delivery
- Reusable: Yes - Applies to any difficult conversation
- Valuable: Yes - Critical management skill with clear methodology

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

### 6. ruthless-prioritization-audit

**Source Pattern:** Ruthless Prioritization (Management Philosophy)
**Purpose:** Audit current priorities and ruthlessly cut to the top 2-3 that will have the most impact
**Trigger:** "I have too many priorities", "I can't do everything", "What should I focus on?", "I'm overwhelmed with work"
**Inputs:** Current priority list, available time/resources, strategic objectives
**Outputs:** Prioritized list (top 2-3 only), cut list with rationale, resource allocation plan

**Criteria Evaluation:**
- Actionable: Yes - Clear process of identifying 10 things and cutting to top 2
- Invocable: Yes - Common productivity/leadership challenge
- Scoped: Yes - Focused on prioritization decisions
- Reusable: Yes - Applies to any overwhelm/prioritization situation
- Valuable: Moderate - Useful but less distinctive than other Sandberg frameworks

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

**Reasoning:** Ruthless prioritization is a cornerstone of operational excellence but is less uniquely Sandberg than other frameworks. Still valuable as it grounds prioritization in her actual practice at Facebook.

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Feedback Culture (twice-weekly meetings) | Too specific to executive context; more of a practice than a reusable skill |
| Creating Psychological Safety | Overlaps with broader psychological safety skills; Sandberg's contribution is illustrative rather than methodological |
| The Larry Summers Connection | Biography/reference material, not actionable workflow |
| Facebook/Meta Growth statistics | Reference data, no workflow |
| The Confidence Gap (60%/100% data) | Supporting evidence for lean-in-career-assessment, not standalone skill |
| The Likeability Penalty | Reference knowledge that informs other skills but not actionable on its own |
| Lean In Circles | Organizational program, not individual skill |

## Existing Skills Check

Checked against existing skills in `/skills/`:

- No direct duplicates found
- Potential overlap with general feedback skills (4a-feedback-delivery) - but Sandberg framework is distinct
- Potential overlap with resilience skills - but Three Ps framework is specific enough to warrant standalone skill
