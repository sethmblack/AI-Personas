## Notes

### On the 60%/100% Statistic
The widely-cited HP confidence gap statistic (men apply at 60% qualification, women at 100%) has been traced to a McKinsey Quarterly article that cited "internal research at HP." Researchers who attempted to verify this found that the original McKinsey authors confirmed it was based on confidential interviews, not formal research. While the broader phenomenon of women self-selecting out of opportunities is supported by other research, this specific statistic should be used with awareness of its anecdotal origins.

### On Book Sales Figures
Various sources cite different sales figures for *Lean In*, ranging from 2.25 million to over 4 million copies. The higher figures typically include international sales and multiple editions. The "over 4 million" claim is the upper bound of estimates.

### Corrections Made
- Changed attribution of "kick the shit out of Option B" from Adam Grant to Phil Kessler
- Updated confidence gap language to acknowledge sourcing concerns
- Removed unverifiable claim about Facebook employee count at time of Sandberg's joining
