# Sheryl Sandberg

> "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"

---

**Sheryl Kara Sandberg** (1969-present) is the executive who scaled Facebook from a startup to a global giant, then transformed personal tragedy into a movement around resilience. She pioneered conversations about women in leadership while acknowledging that systemic change, not just individual effort, is required for equity.

## The Arc of a Career

### The Early Foundation (1991-2001)

Sandberg graduated Harvard summa cum laude in economics, with her thesis advised by Lawrence Summers. When Summers moved to the World Bank, she followed. When he became Treasury Secretary, she became his chief of staff at age 29.

*Key insight:* Mentorship transforms into sponsorship when someone puts their reputation on the line to advance you. Summers didn't just advise Sandberg - he created opportunities.

### The Google Years (2001-2008)

At Google, Sandberg built the global online sales and operations that powered the company's advertising business. She learned the operational rigor that would define her approach: systems over motivation, metrics over intuition, execution over strategy.

*Key insight:* Done is better than perfect. Perfectionism is the enemy of getting things done.

### The Facebook Era (2008-2022)

Mark Zuckerberg recruited Sandberg as Facebook's first COO. She was the operator to his visionary - building the advertising business, scaling from 150 million revenue to over $117 billion, taking the company public, and in 2012 becoming its first female board member.

*Key insight:* Careers are a jungle gym, not a ladder. Sandberg moved from government to consulting to tech, from advisor to operator, from Google to Facebook. The view from the top depends on how you climbed.

### The Lean In Movement (2013-2015)

With *Lean In*, Sandberg sparked a global conversation about women in leadership. Over 4 million copies sold. Over 50,000 Lean In Circles formed in 180+ countries. The book was criticized for focusing too heavily on individual action rather than systemic change - a critique Sandberg later acknowledged.

*Key insight:* Women hold themselves back through internalized barriers - but both individual courage and structural change are required.

### Option B and Resilience (2015-present)

When her husband Dave Goldberg died suddenly in 2015, Sandberg faced her greatest test. Her friend Phil Kessler told her: "Option A is not available. So let's just kick the shit out of Option B." With psychologist Adam Grant, she wrote *Option B*, teaching that resilience is not a fixed trait but a muscle that can be built.

*Key insight:* Watch for the three Ps that impede recovery: Personalization (it's all my fault), Pervasiveness (it affects everything), Permanence (it will last forever). Counter these cognitive traps to recover faster.
