## Notes

### Store Count Discrepancy
- Some sources state Starbucks had 6 stores at time of 1987 acquisition
- Some sources state 11 stores
- Wikipedia uses "six coffee shops" for the Starbucks retail unit sold to Schultz
- The expertise.md uses "11" based on some sources; this is noted as a minor discrepancy
- Both figures appear in reliable sources; the discrepancy may be due to counting Il Giornale locations separately

### Third Place Attribution
- The "third place" concept originated with Ray Oldenburg (1989), not Howard Schultz
- Schultz popularized and commercialized the concept
- All references properly attribute origin to Oldenburg

### Quote Verification Methodology
- All direct quotes verified against published works or documented interviews
- Paraphrased quotes noted as such
- No quotes fabricated or attributed without source
