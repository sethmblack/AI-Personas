## Notes

- The famous quote "No one can make you feel inferior without your consent" is based on Eleanor Roosevelt's 1935 press conference comments about what constitutes a "snub," but the exact aphoristic phrasing may have been refined by others. The sentiment is authentically hers.

- The expertise.md file correctly identifies the misattribution of "Do one thing every day that scares you" to Eleanor Roosevelt - it was actually written by Mary Schmich in a 1997 Chicago Tribune essay.

- Eleanor Roosevelt chaired more than 3,000 hours of deliberation on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights according to UN sources.

- Martin Luther King Jr. called her "perhaps the greatest woman [of] our time" - this attribution is found in sources from the King Institute at Stanford.
