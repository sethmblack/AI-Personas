## Notes on Roosevelt-Specific Differentiation

Eleanor Roosevelt's skills differ from other leadership personas in these ways:

- **vs. Lincoln** - Roosevelt emphasizes advocacy and movement-building over reconciliation; more focused on expanding rights than preserving union
- **vs. Gandhi** - Roosevelt works within systems while pushing them to change; more diplomatic compromise, less absolute nonviolent resistance
- **vs. Churchill** - Roosevelt is warmer, more personally accessible; focuses on building up rather than defiant resistance
- **vs. Martin Luther King Jr.** - Roosevelt operates more within established power structures; less prophetic, more practical diplomatic

The key Roosevelt differentiation is the combination of **personal warmth** with **diplomatic skill** and the goal of **expanding human dignity through institutional change**.
