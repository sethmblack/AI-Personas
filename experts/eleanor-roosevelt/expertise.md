# Eleanor Roosevelt: Expertise Research

## Overview

Anna Eleanor Roosevelt (1884-1962) served as First Lady of the United States from 1933 to 1945 during her husband Franklin D. Roosevelt's unprecedented four terms. She fundamentally transformed the role of First Lady from ceremonial spouse to independent political actor. After FDR's death, she continued her public service as a United Nations delegate, chairing the commission that produced the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. President Harry S. Truman called her the "First Lady of the World" in tribute to her human rights achievements.

## Historical Context

### The Universal Declaration of Human Rights

In December 1945, President Harry Truman appointed Eleanor Roosevelt as a delegate to the first session of the United Nations General Assembly. She served as the first Chairperson of the UN Commission on Human Rights, leading the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from 1946 through 1948.

Roosevelt faced extraordinary challenges: Cold War tensions between the US and Soviet Union, balancing civil/political rights with social/economic rights, and navigating ideological divides. On December 10, 1948, after she introduced the final draft to the General Assembly, 48 nations gave their approval with no negative votes, followed by an unprecedented standing ovation.

Roosevelt herself regarded her role in drafting and securing adoption of the Declaration as her greatest achievement. A permanent memorial was dedicated on December 5, 2008, at the Place des Nations in Geneva, Switzerland.

### "My Day" Column (1935-1962)

"My Day" was a newspaper column written by Eleanor Roosevelt six days a week for 27 years, making her the first First Lady to write a daily newspaper column. At its height, the column appeared in 90 papers with a reading audience of over 4 million.

The columns evolved from chronicles of daily activities to substantive political and social commentary on civil rights, women's rights, and international affairs. Her conversational, intimate style made complex issues accessible and created a sense of personal connection with readers.

### Civil Rights Advocacy

Roosevelt was significantly more advanced than her husband on civil rights issues:

- **The Marian Anderson Concert (1939):** When the DAR refused to let Marian Anderson sing in Constitution Hall, Eleanor resigned from the organization and arranged for Anderson to sing at the Lincoln Memorial before an estimated 75,000 people.
- **Anti-Lynching Legislation:** She lobbied for federal anti-lynching legislation despite political resistance.
- **New Deal Equity:** She insisted that New Deal benefits be equally extended to Americans of all races.
- **White House Integration:** She broke tradition by inviting hundreds of African-American guests to the White House.

Martin Luther King Jr. called Mrs. Roosevelt "perhaps the greatest woman [of] our time."

### Women's Rights Activism

Roosevelt became fully involved in the women's rights movement in the 1920s, serving on the New York State League of Women Voters and leading the Women's Division of the New York State Democratic Committee.

As First Lady, she instituted press conferences for women correspondents only (forcing wire services to employ women), advocated for camps for unemployed women, and held the White House Conference for Unemployed Women in 1934.

In 1960, she chaired President Kennedy's Commission on the Status of Women, which released a groundbreaking study on gender discrimination. She also worked on the Equal Pay Act, passed in 1963.
