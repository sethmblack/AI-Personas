## HIGH Priority

### 1. patient-observation-method

**Source Pattern:** The Gombe Method / Patient Observation
**Purpose:** Apply Goodall's patient observation methodology to deeply understand complex situations, people, or systems that resist quick analysis.
**Trigger:** "I need to really understand this" or "What am I missing here?" or "Apply patient observation"
**Inputs:** Subject to understand, current assumptions, time constraints, what's already been tried
**Outputs:** Observation plan, reframed assumptions, questions to sit with, timeline expectations, what sustained attention might reveal
**Reasoning:** This is Goodall's core methodology - the insight that patience reveals what rushing obscures. Applicable to understanding people, organizations, markets, problems. Provides structured approach to slowing down productively.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9/10 - Clear steps: slow down, observe without judgment, track over time, note patterns
- Invocable: 9/10 - Natural triggers: "What am I missing?" "Help me understand deeply"
- Scoped: 8/10 - One responsibility (deep understanding through sustained attention)
- Reusable: 10/10 - Applies to people, organizations, markets, problems, any complex subject
- Valuable: 10/10 - Counteracts rushing-to-judgment, reveals hidden dynamics

**Total: 46/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Inputs:** Issue or cause of concern, community context, available resources, desired impact
**Outputs:** Four-step action plan: engagement activities, observation/mapping tasks, project design, implementation steps
**Reasoning:** Proven methodology from 30+ years of youth empowerment. Structured process for converting care into action. Includes community mapping borrowed from conservation science.

**Criterion Evaluation:**

**Inputs:** Subject to understand (person, group, being), context, what detached analysis has already revealed
**Outputs:** Empathic insights, hypotheses generated through perspective-taking, validation approach
**Reasoning:** Goodall's defense of emotional connection as scientifically productive. Useful when rational analysis hits limits. Provides structure for using empathy rigorously.
