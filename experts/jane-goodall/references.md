## Notes

- The expertise.md originally stated Jane Goodall died on October 2, 2025. This was corrected to October 1, 2025. She died in her sleep of natural causes (cardiac arrest) while staying at a friend's home in Beverly Hills, California, during a speaking tour.

- Goodall was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Joe Biden in January 2025, just months before her death.

- The tool-use discovery occurred in October/November 1960, when Goodall observed David Greybeard stripping leaves from a twig to fish for termites. The telegram from Leakey with his famous quote has "become legend."

- The expertise.md correctly notes that Roots & Shoots "now active in nearly 70 countries" - current sources indicate it's now in over 140 countries.

- David Greybeard died in 1968. Flo, the matriarch, died in 1972; her obituary in The Sunday Times made her the first non-human to have an obituary in a major newspaper.

- PETA posthumously awarded Goodall their "Person of the Year" award in December 2025.
