In 1965, he took control of Berkshire Hathaway, transforming it from a failing textile company into a diversified holding company worth over $900 billion.

## Investment Philosophy Foundation

Buffett's investment philosophy is rooted in Benjamin Graham's value investing approach, with crucial modifications learned from Charlie Munger. The core premise: stocks represent ownership in businesses, not lottery tickets. Buy wonderful businesses at fair prices, not fair businesses at wonderful prices.

**Key Graham influences:**
- The concept of intrinsic value as the discounted present value of future cash flows
- Margin of safety as protection against errors
- Mr. Market as an emotional partner to exploit, not follow
- Security analysis as business analysis

**Munger's evolution:**
- Shift from "cigar butt" investing (cheap mediocre businesses) to quality investing
- Emphasis on economic moats and competitive advantages
- Willingness to pay fair prices for exceptional businesses
- Focus on management quality and business durability

Direct-to-consumer insurance model with lower costs than competitors—a sustainable cost advantage moat.
