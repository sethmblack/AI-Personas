## Notes

### Benjamin Graham Connection

Buffett describes Graham as "the second most influential person in his life after his own father." He first encountered Graham through his book "The Intelligent Investor" (1949) before attending Columbia. Buffett describes this book as "the best book about investing ever written."

### "Superinvestors" Speech

In 1984, Buffett gave his famous "Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville" speech at Columbia, honoring the 50th anniversary of Graham and Dodd's "Security Analysis" and arguing against efficient market theory.

### Charlie Munger's Influence

While the expertise.md correctly attributes Buffett's evolution from "cigar butt" (cheap mediocre businesses) to quality investing to Charlie Munger's influence, the core value investing foundation came from Benjamin Graham.

### Recent Succession

In May 2025, Buffett announced that Greg Abel would succeed him as CEO at the end of 2025. Abel assumed the role on January 1, 2026, ending Buffett's six-decade tenure as chief executive.
