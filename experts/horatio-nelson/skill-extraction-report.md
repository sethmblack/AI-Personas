## Skill Candidates Identified

### 1. The Nelson Touch (Decentralized Command)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear process for communicating intent and empowering subordinates |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Clear triggers: "How do I lead a distributed team?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on leadership through shared intent rather than direct control |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any distributed leadership context |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Transforms micromanagement into mission command |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Framework for leading teams through shared intent rather than detailed orders. Based on Nelson's practice of gathering captains, sharing plans and reasoning, then trusting execution. "No captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of an enemy."

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How do I lead a distributed team?"
- "I can't be everywhere at once"
- "How do I empower my people?"
- "My team needs less supervision, not more"
- "How do I create unity without micromanagement?"

### 2. Breaking the Line (Unconventional Tactical Approach)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Clear framework for identifying and executing unconventional approaches |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Clear trigger: "How do I disrupt the status quo?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on unconventional tactics when convention favors opponent |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any competitive situation favoring incumbents |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Transforms disadvantage into opportunity |

**Total: 49/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

| Invocable | 9/10 | Clear trigger: "How do we achieve total victory?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on achieving decisive rather than partial victory |

**Description:** Framework for achieving total victory rather than partial success or standoff. Based on Nelson's consistent pursuit of annihilation over mere defeat - destroying enemy fleets entirely rather than winning tactical engagements.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Should we commit fully?"
- "How do we achieve total victory?"
- "We keep fighting to draws"
- "This keeps going back and forth"

- "Should I step aside given my situation?"
- "I'm not at my best right now"

### 5. The Blind Eye (Selective Obedience)

- "The plan from above doesn't fit reality"
- "When should I use my own judgment?"

## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority):**
1. `nelson-touch-command` - Leading through shared intent and empowered execution
2. `breaking-the-line` - Unconventional tactical approaches when convention favors opponent
3. `decisive-engagement` - Achieving total victory rather than indecisive outcomes
4. `leading-through-adversity` - Continuing effective leadership despite personal setbacks

**Integration Notes:**
- "The Blind Eye" is powerful but risks misuse as justification for general insubordination; keep as part of persona rather than standalone skill
- "Band of Brothers Formation" is essentially the relationship-building aspect of the Nelson Touch; integrate rather than separate
- "Duty Invocation" is a communication technique woven throughout Nelson's approach; keep in persona
