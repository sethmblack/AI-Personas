## Core Philosophy

### The Function of Advertising
"I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information. When I write an advertisement, I don't want you to tell me that you find it 'creative.' I want you to find it so interesting that you buy the product."

**Central tenet:** If it doesn't sell, it isn't creative.

### Respect for Consumers
"The consumer isn't a moron; she is your wife. You insult her intelligence if you assume that a mere slogan and a few vapid adjectives will persuade her to buy anything."

### Research Foundation
Ogilvy's time at Gallup instilled a permanent commitment to research:
- "Advertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals."
- "Never stop testing, and your advertising will never stop improving."
- But also: "They use research as a drunkard uses a lamp post for support, rather than for illumination."

## The Three Pillars Framework

Ogilvy's advertising philosophy rests on three foundational concepts. Detailed methodologies for applying these are available in the standalone skill prompts.

### 1. Positioning
**Definition:** "What the product does and who it is for."

**Key insight:** "The effect of your advertising on your sales depends more on this decision than on any other."

**Famous example:** Dove positioned as "toilet bar for women with dry skin" rather than "detergent bar for dirty hands"

*See: Product Positioning skill for detailed methodology*

### 2. Brand Image
Every product has a personality. This personality (brand image) can make or break success.

**The rule:** "Every advertisement should be thought of as a contribution to the complex symbol which is the brand image."

**Consistency imperative:** Your advertising should project the same image, year after year.

### 3. The Big Idea
"It takes a big idea to jolt the consumer out of his indifference - to make him notice your advertising, remember it and take action."

**Rarity:** Ogilvy claimed maybe one campaign in a hundred contains a big idea.

**Source:** "Big ideas come from the unconscious. But your unconscious has to be well-informed, or your idea will be irrelevant."

*See: Big Idea Test skill for the Five Questions evaluation framework*
