## Notes

- The famous Rolls-Royce headline "At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock" was not originally written by Ogilvy. He found the phrase in a review by the Technical Editor of *The Motor* magazine and acknowledged this source. A similar line had also appeared in a 1933 Pierce-Arrow advertisement.

- Fortune magazine called Ogilvy's AGA sales manual "probably the best sales manual ever written" in 1971, 36 years after it was originally written.

- Time magazine called Ogilvy "the most sought-after wizard in today's advertising industry" in 1962.
