## HIGH Priority

### 1. growth-mindset-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** Growth Mindset Framework (via Carol Dweck)
**Purpose:** Diagnose fixed vs. growth mindset patterns in individuals, teams, or organizations and provide transformation guidance
**Trigger:** "Is this fixed mindset thinking?" or "Why is my team resistant to change?" or "We're stuck defending old approaches" or "How do we build a learning culture?"
**Inputs:** Description of situation, behavior, or organizational pattern exhibiting resistance, defensiveness, or stagnation
**Outputs:** Diagnosis of fixed mindset indicators, root cause analysis, specific interventions to shift toward growth mindset, progress metrics
**Reasoning:** Clear actionable framework (fixed vs. growth table), explicit steps (replace stack ranking, change review questions), high reuse across coaching, team dynamics, and organizational change. Used whenever transformation is blocked by ego or fear. Saves significant time vs. intuitive diagnosis.

### 2. cultural-transformation-framework

**Source Pattern:** Cultural Transformation Methodology (Stack Ranking to Learn-It-All)
**Purpose:** Guide large-scale organizational culture change from toxic/competitive to collaborative/growth-oriented
**Trigger:** "How do we change our culture?" or "Our teams are competing instead of collaborating" or "We have a toxic culture" or "Culture is blocking our strategy"
**Inputs:** Current culture description (symptoms, practices, outcomes), desired future state, organizational constraints
**Outputs:** Diagnosis of cultural blockers, phased transformation plan, specific practice replacements (what to stop, what to start), measurement framework, communication strategy
**Reasoning:** Detailed before/after methodology documented (stack ranking to growth reviews, management meetings to hackathons). High value for any organization undertaking cultural change. Repeatable 5+ step process with clear success metrics. Microsoft's results prove efficacy.

### 3. empathy-driven-innovation

**Source Pattern:** Empathy as Business Strategy / Four Types of Empathy
**Purpose:** Apply systematic empathy to uncover innovation opportunities and improve stakeholder relationships
**Trigger:** "We've lost touch with our customers" or "How do we innovate?" or "Our product isn't resonating" or "We need to understand our users better"
**Inputs:** Target stakeholder group (customers, employees, partners, society), current understanding level, specific pain points or relationship issues
**Outputs:** Empathy mapping for stakeholder group, identified unmet needs, innovation opportunities, relationship improvement actions, measurement approach
**Reasoning:** Four-type framework (employees, customers, partners, society) is actionable and distinct. Each type has specific practices (bypass hierarchy, understand pain before building). Directly tied to innovation outcomes. Applicable across product development, leadership, and partnerships.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. partnership-ecosystem-strategy

**Source Pattern:** Platform Thinking Principles / Partnership Over Competition
**Purpose:** Transform competitive relationships into partnership opportunities and design ecosystem strategies
**Trigger:** "Should we partner with our competitor?" or "How do we build an ecosystem?" or "Old rivalries are blocking us" or "We're fighting battles we can't win"
**Inputs:** Current competitive relationships, strategic goals, partnership constraints
**Outputs:** Partnership opportunity assessment, ecosystem value map, coopetition analysis, partnership structure recommendations
**Reasoning:** Clear principles from "Microsoft loves Linux" transformation. Partnership-focused variant distinct from existing platform-strategy-assessment (Bill Gates expert). High value for competitive strategy and ecosystem building. Note: platform-strategy-assessment already exists; this skill focuses on partnership/coopetition aspects.

### 5. strategic-pivot-framework

**Source Pattern:** Mobile-First Cloud-First / "If you don't jump on the new, you don't survive"
**Purpose:** Guide organizations through existential platform transitions while managing legacy business
**Trigger:** "Our market is shifting" or "Should we cannibalize our own product?" or "We're defending the status quo" or "The platform is changing under us"
**Inputs:** Current business position, emerging platform/technology threat, legacy business dependencies, organizational resistance points
**Outputs:** Pivot assessment (stay/shift/hybrid), cannibalization strategy, transition timeline, messaging framework, risk mitigation plan
**Reasoning:** Nadella's Windows-to-cloud pivot is documented case study with clear decision points. "Thinking in decades, executing in quarters" provides temporal framework. Applicable when facing disruption. Medium priority as less common than cultural work.

### 6. acquisition-evaluation-framework

**Source Pattern:** Major Acquisitions methodology
**Purpose:** Evaluate acquisition targets using Nadella's ecosystem/platform criteria
**Trigger:** "Should we acquire this company?" or "How do we think about M&A?" or "Is this acquisition strategic?" or "We're considering a major purchase"
**Inputs:** Target company profile, strategic rationale hypothesis, integration concerns, ecosystem implications
**Outputs:** Acquisition scorecard (ecosystem value, cultural fit, unique contribution potential), integration approach, risk assessment, alternative strategies
**Reasoning:** Clear documented criteria ("unique contribution from technology, brand, go-to-market"). Five major acquisitions provide case studies. Applicable to M&A decisions. Medium priority due to infrequent use but high stakes when invoked.
