## HIGH Priority

### 1. vitality-curve-assessment

**Source Pattern:** 20-70-10 Differentiation / Rank and Yank / Performance Distribution
**Purpose:** Assess and categorize team members into performance tiers (top 20%, vital 70%, bottom 10%) with clear actions for each tier.
**Trigger:** "How do I evaluate my team?", "Who should I promote?", "We have performance problems", "How do I differentiate performers?"
**Inputs:** Team roster, performance data, behavioral observations, peer feedback
**Outputs:** Tiered categorization, action plans for each tier, development recommendations, removal timeline for bottom tier
**Reasoning:** Welch's most distinctive and controversial contribution. Provides concrete framework for performance differentiation that many organizations struggle with. Must include both application guidance AND warnings about common failure modes.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES (10/10) - Clear 20-70-10 categorization, specific actions for each tier
- Invocable: YES (10/10) - Performance evaluation questions trigger naturally
- Scoped: YES (9/10) - Team evaluation; distinct from hiring or strategy
- Reusable: YES (10/10) - Any team, any organization, any industry
- Valuable: YES (9/10) - Addresses the #1 management failure (not differentiating)

**Score: 48/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

### 2. bureaucracy-busting-workout

**Source Pattern:** Work-Out Sessions / Rapid Bureaucracy Elimination

**Inputs:** Team or organization to audit, current pain points, decision-maker who can approve changes
**Outputs:** List of bureaucratic practices to eliminate, immediate decisions on proposals, 30-60-90 day implementation plan
**Reasoning:** Work-Out is Welch's most universally applicable methodology. Unlike the vitality curve (controversial), Work-Out is almost universally valuable. Provides immediate ROI through process elimination.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES (10/10) - Specific session format, decision requirements, follow-up structure
- Invocable: YES (10/10) - Bureaucracy complaints are universal trigger
- Scoped: YES (10/10) - Process elimination; clear boundaries

### 3. number-one-or-two-analysis

**Source Pattern:** #1 or #2 Doctrine / Fix, Sell, or Close / Portfolio Strategy
**Purpose:** Evaluate a business unit or product line's market position and determine whether to fix, sell, or close based on competitive position.

**Inputs:** Business unit description, market position data, competitive landscape, financial performance
**Outputs:** Market position assessment, fix/sell/close recommendation, action plan with timeline
**Reasoning:** Welch's portfolio discipline forced rigorous resource allocation. The framework prevents the common trap of subsidizing weak businesses with profits from strong ones. Highly actionable for any multi-business organization.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES (10/10) - Clear position test, binary decision framework
- Invocable: YES (9/10) - Portfolio and investment questions trigger
- Scoped: YES (9/10) - Business unit evaluation; distinct from operational improvement
- Reusable: YES (9/10) - Any organization with multiple products/units

### 4. four-es-leadership-evaluation

**Source Pattern:** Four Es and One P / Leadership Selection Criteria
**Purpose:** Evaluate current or potential leaders against Welch's five criteria: Energy, Energize, Edge, Execute, and Passion.
**Trigger:** "Is this person a good leader?", "Who should I promote?", "How do I evaluate leadership?", "What makes a great leader?"
**Inputs:** Person to evaluate, observations of their behavior, performance history, peer/subordinate feedback
**Outputs:** Scores on each E+P dimension, overall leadership assessment, development recommendations
**Reasoning:** Leadership selection criteria that Welch used to build a legendary management bench. Provides memorable framework that can be applied to hiring, promotion, and development decisions.

**Inputs:** Current cultural observations, examples of candor failures, feedback mechanisms, leadership behavior
**Outputs:** Candor deficit diagnosis, root cause analysis, implementation roadmap, leader behavior changes required
**Reasoning:** Welch considered lack of candor the "biggest dirty little secret in business." The framework addresses a universal organizational problem and provides specific remedies.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES (9/10) - Diagnosis criteria and intervention steps
- Invocable: YES (9/10) - Culture and communication questions trigger
- Scoped: YES (8/10) - Culture/communication; some overlap with other culture frameworks

**Inputs:** Organizational structure, communication patterns, decision flows, examples of boundary failures
**Outputs:** Boundary map, specific barriers identified, recommendations for each boundary type
**Reasoning:** Valuable framework but somewhat abstract compared to Work-Out. More diagnostic than actionable - identifies problems but remedies are context-dependent.

- Actionable: MODERATE (7/10) - Diagnosis is clear, but remedies vary by context
- Invocable: YES (9/10) - Silo complaints are common trigger
- Scoped: YES (8/10) - Organizational design; overlaps with culture

**Trigger:** "We're too slow", "Everything is complicated", "People lack confidence to act"
**Inputs:** Current state observations, decision speed data, process complexity examples
**Outputs:** Assessment on each S, specific gaps, recommendations
**Reasoning:** Useful cultural framework but overlaps significantly with other skills (Work-Out addresses speed and simplicity, candor addresses self-confidence). Better integrated than standalone.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: MODERATE (7/10) - Assessment criteria clear, but solutions overlap other skills
- Invocable: MODERATE (7/10) - Triggers overlap with other skills
- Scoped: NARROW (6/10) - Overlaps significantly with Work-Out and candor

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Vitality Curve Warning
The vitality-curve-assessment skill MUST include:
- Clear warnings about failure modes (politics, collaboration destruction)
- Prerequisites (candor culture, clear metrics) before implementation
- Alternative approaches for high-performing teams
- Historical context about companies abandoning the practice

### Balanced Treatment
Jack Welch's methodologies produced extraordinary results AND significant criticisms. Skills should:
- Present the methodology accurately
- Note when and why it works
- Acknowledge legitimate criticisms
- Provide guidance on contextual application

## Skill Interaction Map

```
candor-culture-assessment
          |
          |-- enables --> vitality-curve-assessment (candor is prerequisite)
          |
          |-- enables --> bureaucracy-busting-workout (requires honest input)

number-one-or-two-analysis
          |
          |-- informs --> resource allocation for differentiated talent

four-es-leadership-evaluation
          |
          |-- identifies --> who leads transformation
          |
          |-- inputs to --> vitality-curve-assessment (for leaders)
```

The candor-culture-assessment is foundational - without candor, the vitality curve becomes political and Work-Out produces sanitized complaints. Number-one-or-two-analysis operates at portfolio level while vitality curve operates at team level.

## Next Steps

To create approved skills, implement in this order:

1. **bureaucracy-busting-workout** - Start with least controversial, most valuable
2. **candor-culture-assessment** - Foundation for other skills
3. **vitality-curve-assessment** - With appropriate warnings
4. **number-one-or-two-analysis** - Portfolio discipline
5. **four-es-leadership-evaluation** - Leadership selection

## Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Added to `experts/jack-welch/PROMPT.md` in "Assigned Skills" section (already present)
2. Triggered proactively when the Jack Welch expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly
4. Include balanced perspective acknowledging both strengths and criticisms
