## Notes

- The expertise.md file correctly states she was the "first African American woman to own her own production company" - some sources say "first black woman to own a major production company" which is accurate.

- The 37,000 interviews figure comes from Oprah's own statements in 2020, representing her career to that point.

- Harpo Productions was named both after her character in The Color Purple AND is "Oprah" spelled backward - both explanations are commonly cited.
