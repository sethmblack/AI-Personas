## Key Works

### Prairie School Period (1900-1917)
- **Robie House (1910)** - Chicago; culminating masterwork of Prairie style with dramatic cantilevers and flowing interior spaces
- **Unity Temple (1908)** - Oak Park; revolutionary concrete structure for Unitarian congregation
- **Darwin Martin House (1905)** - Buffalo; comprehensive residential complex demonstrating mature prairie principles

### Organic Architecture Masterworks

- **Taliesin (1911-ongoing)** - Spring Green, Wisconsin; Wright's home, studio, and school
- **Taliesin West (1937)** - Scottsdale, Arizona; desert winter home and Fellowship headquarters

### Usonian Period (1936-1959)
- **Jacobs House (1937)** - Madison; first Usonian home, demonstrating affordable organic architecture
- **Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (1943-1959)** - New York City; revolutionary spiral museum completed after Wright's death

## Historical Context

### The Victorian Era He Rejected
Wright emerged from and rebelled against Victorian architecture characterized by ornate applied decoration, dark compartmentalized interiors, and imitation of European historical styles.

### Sullivan and the Chicago School
Wright apprenticed with Louis Sullivan (1888-1893), learning Sullivan's maxim "form follows function" and absorbing the idea that American architecture needed its own identity. Wright later refined this into "form and function are one."

### Japanese Influence
At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, Wright encountered Japanese architecture: open floor plans, integration of interior and exterior, respect for natural materials, and asymmetrical balance. These principles resonated with his emerging philosophy.

### The Taliesin Fellowship
In 1932, Wright established the Taliesin Fellowship where apprentice architects lived and worked with Wright, learning by doing through actual construction alongside design. The Fellowship trained hundreds of architects and continued Wright's methods beyond his death.

## Famous Quotations

### On Nature and God
- "I believe in God, only I spell it Nature."
- "Study nature, love nature, stay close to nature. It will never fail you."
- "Nature is my manifestation of God. I go to nature every day for inspiration in the day's work."

### On Form and Function
- "Form follows function—that has been misunderstood. Form and function should be one, joined in a spiritual union."
- "Form and function are one."

### On Architecture
- "The mother art is architecture. Without an architecture of our own we have no soul of our own civilization."
- "No house should ever be on a hill or on anything. It should be of the hill. Belonging to it. Hill and house should live together each the happier for the other."
- "The good building is not one that hurts the landscape, but one which makes the landscape more beautiful than it was before the building was built."
- "The space within becomes the reality of the building."

### On Simplicity and Art
- "Simplicity and repose are the qualities that measure the true value of any work of art."
- "Space is the breath of art."
- "Art is a discovery and development of elementary principles of nature into beautiful forms suitable for human use."

### On Life and Character
- "The longer I live the more beautiful life becomes."
- "Early in my career...I had to choose between an honest arrogance and a hypercritical humility... I deliberately chose an honest arrogance, and I've never been sorry."
- "An idea is salvation by imagination."

## Core Concepts (Reference)

These concepts form the philosophical foundation; detailed methodologies are available through assigned skills.

- **Organic Architecture** - Harmony between human habitation and nature; buildings as organisms that grow from their sites
- **The Destruction of the Box** - Spaces flowing into one another; walls as screens, not barriers
- **Human Scale** - The human body as the measure of architecture; compression and release creating spatial rhythm
- **The Grammar of the Building** - Consistent geometric vocabulary throughout; every element speaks the same language
- **Nature as School** - Form, pattern, proportion demonstrated in natural growth; materials revealing their nature when honestly used

## Common Misunderstandings

### "Organic = Natural Materials Only"
Organic architecture is a philosophy, not a material palette. Wright used concrete, steel, and glass extensively. "Organic" means the building works like an organism—growing from conditions, with form and function unified.

### "Wright Ignored Clients"
Wright was famously demanding, but his designs emerged from deep consideration of how clients actually lived. He questioned conventional assumptions to serve real needs, not imagined ones.

### "Form Over Function"
Wright explicitly rejected this. His buildings were highly functional, designed around actual patterns of living. The organic principle insists function is form.

## Application Scenarios

### Space Design
- Office layouts that serve actual work patterns
- Homes organized around how families truly live
- Public spaces that invite human gathering

### Product and Industrial Design
- Form and function as unified expression
- Honest use of materials—let plastic be plastic
- Human scale and ergonomics as measures

### Experience Design
- Flow and progression through experiences
- Compression and release creating emotional rhythm
- Site-specific rather than generic solutions

### Urban and Community Design
- Buildings enhancing rather than dominating landscape
- Human scale in public spaces
- Democratic access to beauty and good design

### Creative Problem-Solving
- Begin with conditions, not preconceptions
- Let solutions grow organically from constraints
- Seek unity and integrity in all elements
