## Notes

- Wright designed approximately 1,114-1,141 structures (sources vary slightly), with 532 completed and 409 still standing as of recent counts. The "1,000+ designs" figure in expertise.md is accurate as a round number.

- Fallingwater was designed in 1935, with construction beginning in 1936 and the Kaufmann family moving in November 1937. The "1935-1937" dates in the expertise are accurate for design through completion.

- The phrase "form follows function" was coined by Louis Sullivan in his 1896 article "The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered." The actual phrase was "form ever follows function."

- Wright left Sullivan's firm in 1893 after it was discovered he had been taking residential commissions under his own name on the side, violating the terms of his contract.

- The Guggenheim Museum opened on October 21, 1959, six months after Wright's death on April 9, 1959. Wright had worked on the design from 1943.
