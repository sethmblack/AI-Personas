## Scoring Criteria

Each skill evaluated on 5 criteria, 10 points each (max 50):

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Actionable | Has explicit steps, clear process, defined outputs |
| Invocable | Natural trigger phrases exist; user would know when to call it |
| Scoped | Single, focused responsibility; not too broad or narrow |
| Reusable | Applies across multiple domains and situations |
| Valuable | Saves significant time or produces substantially better results |

**Priority Thresholds:** HIGH = 40+, MEDIUM = 30-39, LOW = below 30

**Source Pattern:** Signature Analytical Framework / Design Principles Framework
**Purpose:** Analyze any design challenge through Wright's seven-step organic framework to achieve unity between form, function, site, and human purpose.
**Trigger:** "Analyze this design organically" or "How would Wright approach this?" or "Apply organic principles to this problem"
**Inputs:** Description of design challenge, site/context, intended function, constraints
**Outputs:** Structured analysis covering: site conditions, life to be lived, material honesty, spatial flow, unifying principle, simplification opportunities, human service

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | 7 explicit steps with clear outputs |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers for design problems |
| Scoped | 9 | Focused on design analysis through organic lens |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to architecture, products, spaces, experiences |
| Valuable | 10 | Transforms mechanical design into organic solutions |
| **Total** | **48** | **HIGH PRIORITY** |

### 2. site-integration-assessment

**Source Pattern:** "Of the Hill, Not On the Hill" / Site Analysis
**Purpose:** Evaluate how well a design integrates with its context and recommend improvements for organic fit.
**Trigger:** "Does this belong to its site?" or "Evaluate the site integration" or "How should this relate to its context?"
**Inputs:** Design or proposal, site/context description, environmental factors
**Outputs:** Assessment of current integration quality, specific disconnects identified, recommendations for achieving organic relationship with site

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear evaluation criteria and improvement steps |
| Invocable | 9 | "Site integration" is recognizable design concern |
| Scoped | 10 | Single focused assessment |
| Reusable | 9 | Architecture, products, organizations fitting context |
| Valuable | 9 | Prevents generic solutions that ignore conditions |
| **Total** | **46** | **HIGH PRIORITY** |

### 3. material-honesty-audit

**Source Pattern:** The Grammar of Materials / Material Honesty principle
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether materials, resources, or elements are being used according to their true nature, and recommend authentic expression.
**Trigger:** "Is this honest use of materials?" or "Audit material authenticity" or "Are we working with or against the grain?"
**Inputs:** Description of materials/resources used, how they're being employed, desired outcomes
**Outputs:** Honesty assessment for each material/element, specific violations identified, recommendations for authentic expression

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear evaluation against material nature |
| Invocable | 8 | "Material honesty" recognized design principle |
| Scoped | 10 | Single focused audit |
| Reusable | 9 | Physical materials, digital tools, human talents |
| Valuable | 8 | Prevents forcing things against their nature |
| **Total** | **44** | **HIGH PRIORITY** |

### 4. space-flow-design

**Source Pattern:** Space as Reality / Destruction of the Box / Spatial Flow
**Purpose:** Redesign spaces by focusing on interior experience and flow rather than walls and boundaries.
**Trigger:** "Design the space, not the walls" or "How should this space flow?" or "Destroy the box here"
**Inputs:** Current space layout or brief, activities to be accommodated, desired experiential qualities
**Outputs:** Flow diagram, compression/release sequence, recommendations for eliminating unnecessary barriers, connection points between spaces

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear process for spatial redesign |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural trigger when space feels wrong |
| Scoped | 9 | Focused on spatial flow redesign |
| Reusable | 8 | Physical spaces, user experiences, process flows |
| Valuable | 9 | Transforms boxy thinking into flowing design |
| **Total** | **44** | **HIGH PRIORITY** |

---

### 5. design-integrity-check

**Source Pattern:** The Grammar of the Building / Unity and Integrity
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether all elements of a design speak the same language and recommend corrections for unity.
**Trigger:** "Does this design have integrity?" or "Check design unity" or "Do all elements speak the same language?"
**Inputs:** Design with multiple elements/components, intended unifying principle (if known)
**Outputs:** Identified geometric/aesthetic vocabulary, elements that violate the grammar, recommendations for achieving unity

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear audit and correction process |
| Invocable | 8 | Design integrity is recognized concept |
| Scoped | 9 | Single focused evaluation |
| Reusable | 9 | Buildings, products, brands, systems |
| Valuable | 9 | Prevents inconsistent, assembled-feeling designs |
| **Total** | **44** | **HIGH PRIORITY** |

## MEDIUM Priority

### 6. democratic-design-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Usonian Period / Democratic Idealism
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether a design serves broad human needs or only elite ones, and recommend democratization.
**Trigger:** "Is this design democratic?" or "How can we make this accessible to more people?" or "Apply Usonian principles"
**Inputs:** Design or product, target audience, cost/accessibility factors
**Outputs:** Accessibility assessment, barriers to broader use identified, recommendations for democratization without compromising quality

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Process for evaluation and recommendation |
| Invocable | 7 | Less common trigger than other design concerns |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused but broader than single evaluation |
| Reusable | 8 | Products, services, experiences, architecture |
| Valuable | 7 | Important but less immediate than design skills |
| **Total** | **38** | **MEDIUM PRIORITY** |
