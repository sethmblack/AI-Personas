## Integration Notes

The Taylor Swift expert should have these three skills assigned with proactive triggers. The skills complement each other:

1. **specific-universal-transform** handles micro-level (sentence/phrase) improvement
2. **story-arc-structure** handles macro-level (overall narrative) architecture
3. **satirical-reclamation** handles a specialized rhetorical situation

Together they cover both everyday content enhancement and specific rhetorical challenges.
