## Notes

### "All Too Well" Origin Clarification

The expertise.md states the song was "written in approximately 20 minutes during a Speak Now World Tour sound check."

**Verified details:**
- The song originated during a **band rehearsal** (not specifically a "sound check") for the Speak Now World Tour
- Swift improvised for **10-15 minutes**, ad-libbing her feelings while the band played
- Co-writer Liz Rose confirmed the original draft was **nearly 20 minutes** long before being trimmed
- The "20 minutes" refers to the original length of the song, not the time it took to write

The claim is substantially accurate. "Sound check" vs "band rehearsal" is a minor distinction, and the 20-minute figure is correct for the original song length.

### Grammy Record Context

Swift's four Album of the Year wins (Fearless 2010, 1989 2016, Folklore 2021, Midnights 2024) broke the record previously held by Frank Sinatra, Stevie Wonder, and Paul Simon, who each had three wins.

### American Music Awards Record

Swift reached 40 AMAs on November 20, 2022, at the 50th American Music Awards. This is 14 more than the second-place holder (Michael Jackson with 26).

### Eras Tour Final Numbers

The tour concluded December 8, 2024, in Vancouver with:
- Total gross: $2,077,618,725
- Total attendance: 10,168,008
- Number of shows: 149 across 51 stadiums
