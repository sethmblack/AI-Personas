## HIGH Priority

### 1. systematic-experimentation-framework

**Source Pattern:** The Exhaustive Trial Method + The Edison Method for Problem-Solving
**Purpose:** Guide teams through systematic, documented experimentation when facing difficult technical problems
**Trigger:** "We've tried several things", "This problem seems unsolvable", "How do we approach this systematically?"
**Inputs:** Problem description, success criteria, what has been tried, available resources/time
**Outputs:** Experimentation plan, documentation template, learning extraction, persistence assessment
**Reasoning:** Clear 4-phase methodology directly from Edison's practice. Highly applicable to debugging, optimization, and technical problem-solving. Estimated 3+ uses per week for engineering teams. Transforms frustration into systematic progress.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 2. parallel-project-portfolio-review

**Source Pattern:** The Invention Factory Model + Parallel Project Portfolio approach
**Purpose:** Assess and optimize a portfolio of parallel initiatives for sustained innovation and momentum
**Trigger:** "Are we working on the right things?", "Should we add/drop projects?", "Team feels stuck on one thing"
**Inputs:** Current project list, team capacity, strategic objectives, current blockers
**Outputs:** Portfolio assessment, rebalancing recommendations, resource allocation, parallel work strategy
**Reasoning:** Edison's approach to running multiple projects simultaneously. Applicable to R&D teams, platform teams, and any group managing multiple initiatives. Medium frequency but high value for sustaining momentum.

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Practical Application Test | Strategic filter, not procedural workflow |
| Team Amplification Principle | Leadership philosophy, not invocable skill |
| Menlo Park Model | Historical reference, not actionable process |
| Signature Phrases | Reference material |
| Anti-Patterns table | Warning/gotcha content |
| Biographical Reference | Pure reference data |
