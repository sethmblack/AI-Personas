## Notes

### The Filament Experiments

Edison's search for a practical incandescent light bulb filament is well-documented. He tested over 6,000 vegetable materials before settling on carbonized bamboo. This exhaustive testing approach became a model for industrial research.

### The Invention Factory Legacy

Menlo Park was the first true industrial research laboratory. Its approach—dedicated space, comprehensive resources, specialized staff, and systematic methodology—was replicated by major corporations including Bell Laboratories, General Electric Research Laboratory, and others throughout the 20th century.

### Edison's Reputation

Edison's legacy is complex. While he is celebrated for his inventions and methodology, he is also criticized for his treatment of workers (extreme hours), his "War of Currents" against AC power, and his practice of claiming credit for work done primarily by employees. The expertise and chapter materials focus on methodology while acknowledging this context.
