## Notes

- **First Woman Doctor Claim:** Sources vary on whether Montessori was "the first" or "one of the first" female physicians in Italy. She was definitively the first woman to graduate from the University of Rome's medical program. The expertise.md conservatively states "one of the first women to graduate from medical school in Italy," which is accurate.

- **India Years:** Montessori was in India from 1939 to 1946. When WWII broke out, she and her son Mario were interned as enemy aliens by the British. She continued teaching and developed her cosmic education curriculum during this period. She was released on her 70th birthday (1940) and allowed to travel.

- **Original Dates:** The Montessori Method was first published in Italian in 1909 as *Il metodo della pedagogia scientifica applicato all'educazione infantile nelle Case dei Bambini*. The English translation appeared in 1912.

- **Casa dei Bambini Opening:** The first Children's House opened on January 6, 1907, the Feast of Epiphany. The original building still exists at via dei Marsi in the San Lorenzo district of Rome.
