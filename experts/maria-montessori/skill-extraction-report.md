| Actionable | Has clear steps, process, or framework (not just principles) |
| Invocable | Has natural trigger phrases users would actually say |
| Scoped | Single, focused responsibility (not too broad or narrow) |
| Reusable | Applies across multiple contexts (education, work, personal) |
| Valuable | Saves significant time or prevents common errors |

**Thresholds:** HIGH = 40+, MEDIUM = 30-39, LOW = 20-29

**Inputs:** Description of space, intended users (children, adults, learners), activities to be supported, constraints
**Outputs:** Environmental analysis identifying obstacles, specific redesign recommendations addressing accessibility, order, beauty, appropriate challenge, and independence

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear principles (child-sized, accessible, ordered, beautiful, limited, real) with specific implementation guidance | **10**
- Invocable: YES - Natural triggers around space design, environment setup | **9**
- Scoped: YES - Focuses specifically on physical and psychological environment | **9**
- Reusable: YES - Applies to classrooms, homes, offices, makerspaces, any learning space | **9**
- Valuable: YES - Environment is the foundation; most problems trace to environmental issues | **9**

**Total: 46/50 (HIGH)**

### 2. sensitive-period-recognition

**Source Pattern:** Sensitive Periods
**Purpose:** Identify windows of heightened receptivity in a learner's behavior and recommend how to optimize learning during these periods.
**Trigger:** "My child is obsessed with..." or "Why does the learner keep doing this?" or "When is the right time to teach...?"
**Inputs:** Observed behavior patterns, age, intensity and duration of interest, context
**Outputs:** Identification of likely sensitive period, explanation of what the learner is trying to master, recommendations for supporting the period, warnings about what happens if the period is missed or interrupted

- Actionable: YES - Clear indicators (intense focus, repetition, joy, resistance to interruption) and response protocol | **9**
- Invocable: YES - Common parent/teacher questions about intense interests or repetitive behavior | **9**
- Scoped: YES - Focuses on identifying and supporting sensitive periods | **9**
- Reusable: YES - Applies to children of all ages, adult learners rediscovering interests | **8**
- Valuable: YES - Transforms frustrating "obsessions" into developmental opportunities | **9**

**Total: 44/50 (HIGH)**

### 3. follow-the-child-observation

**Source Pattern:** Follow the Child / Observation as Primary Skill
**Purpose:** Conduct systematic observation of a learner to understand their developmental needs, rather than imposing adult assumptions.
**Trigger:** "I don't know what my child/student needs" or "Help me observe" or "What is this behavior telling me?"
**Inputs:** Learner's age, observed behaviors (specific, not interpretive), environment context, adult concerns
**Outputs:** Structured observation framework, interpretation of what the child is showing through their choices/concentration/struggles, recommendations based on following the child's lead

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear observation protocol (record behaviors not interpretations, note patterns, identify periods) | **9**
- Invocable: YES - Parents/teachers frequently ask what behavior means | **9**
- Scoped: YES - Focuses on observation and interpretation | **8**
- Reusable: YES - Works for any age, any learning context, management observation | **8**
- Valuable: YES - Prevents costly misinterpretation of learner needs | **9**

**Total: 43/50 (HIGH)**

### 4. independence-audit

**Source Pattern:** Independence as the Goal / Auto-Education
**Purpose:** Analyze a situation to identify where adults are over-helping, creating dependency rather than capability, and recommend how to step back.
**Trigger:** "Am I helping too much?" or "How do I make them more independent?" or "Why are they so dependent on me?"
**Inputs:** Description of current help/support provided, learner's age and capabilities, specific tasks or areas of concern
**Outputs:** Audit of over-helping behaviors, identification of what the learner could do independently, specific recommendations for stepping back, environmental modifications to support independence

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear principle (every unnecessary help is an obstacle) with audit framework | **9**
- Invocable: YES - Common concern for parents, teachers, managers | **9**
- Scoped: YES - Focuses specifically on independence vs. dependency | **9**
- Reusable: YES - Parenting, teaching, management, mentoring, any helping relationship | **9**
- Valuable: YES - Prevents pervasive error of learned helplessness | **9**

**Total: 45/50 (HIGH)**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. normalization-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** Normalization and Deviations
**Purpose:** Assess whether a learner is "normalized" (developmental needs met) or showing deviations (developmental needs frustrated), and recommend interventions.
**Trigger:** "Is this behavior normal?" or "Why is this child struggling?" or "What's going wrong here?"
**Inputs:** Behavioral patterns, concentration ability, social behavior, relationship with work/learning
**Outputs:** Assessment of normalized vs. deviated state, identification of unmet developmental needs, environmental and relational recommendations

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear indicators for normalized (concentration, self-discipline, joy) vs. deviated (dependence, aggression, inability to concentrate) | **8**
- Invocable: YES - Common concerns about child behavior | **8**
- Scoped: YES - Diagnostic framework for developmental state | **8**
- Reusable: PARTIAL - Primarily child-focused, some adult application | **6**
- Valuable: YES - Transforms behavioral problems into developmental understanding | **8**

**Total: 38/50 (MEDIUM)**

---

### 6. three-period-lesson

**Source Pattern:** The Three-Period Lesson
**Purpose:** Structure the introduction of new vocabulary or concepts using Montessori's proven three-step sequence.
**Trigger:** "How do I introduce this concept?" or "How do I teach vocabulary?" or "What's the three-period lesson?"
**Inputs:** Concept or vocabulary to teach, learner's current knowledge, materials available
**Outputs:** Structured lesson plan with naming, recognition, and recall phases, criteria for advancing between phases

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Three explicit steps with clear success criteria | **9**
- Invocable: YES - Teaching vocabulary/concepts is common need | **7**
- Scoped: YES - Very focused on one teaching technique | **9**
- Reusable: PARTIAL - Primarily for young children and language learning | **6**
- Valuable: MODERATE - Useful but narrow application | **6**

**Total: 37/50 (MEDIUM)**
