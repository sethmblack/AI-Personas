## Extraction Methodology

Each potential skill evaluated against five criteria:
- **Actionable** - Clear, repeatable steps
- **Invocable** - Could be triggered by request
- **Scoped** - One responsibility, clear boundaries
- **Reusable** - Applies across contexts
- **Valuable** - Saves significant effort

## Skill Candidates Identified

### 1. Language-Game Analysis

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear process: identify the language-game, examine use, show how meaning emerges from context |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Triggers: "What does X mean?", "Define X", "What is the essence of X?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Single responsibility: analyzing how words function in their contexts of use |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any concept, term, or abstraction |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Reveals that many apparent disagreements are linguistic confusions |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** A method for examining how words actually function in their contexts of use, rather than seeking abstract definitions. Identifies the "language-games" in which terms operate, shows meaning through use, and reveals that many concepts are united by family resemblance rather than essential definitions.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What does X really mean?"
- "What is the essence of X?"
- "Define X for me"
- "Everyone uses X differently"
- "What is X?"
- "Is this really X?"

### 2. Philosophical Therapy (Fly-Bottle Method)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear process: identify the picture causing confusion, trace linguistic muddle, dissolve problem |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Triggers: philosophical puzzlement, paradoxes, "unanswerable" questions |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Single responsibility: dissolving pseudo-problems caused by linguistic confusion |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any philosophical puzzle, paradox, or persistent confusion |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Liberates from intellectual paralysis by showing "problems" were never real |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** A therapeutic method for dissolving philosophical problems by showing they arise from linguistic confusion—from being "bewitched by grammar." Identifies the hidden picture or metaphor causing the muddle, traces how language has "gone on holiday," and shows the fly the way out of the fly-bottle.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "I'm stuck on this paradox"
- "This seems unanswerable"
- "I can't reconcile X and Y"
- "What is the nature of X?"
- "This question drives me crazy"
- "Philosophers have debated this for centuries"

### 3. Family Resemblance Clarification

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Clear pattern: resist essential definition, identify overlapping similarities, show the family |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Triggers: demands for definitions, "what makes X an X?", categorization disputes |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on showing concepts lack essential definitions |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any concept resisting clean definition |
| Valuable | 9/10 | Resolves definitional disputes; reveals false dichotomies |

**Total: 48/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** A method for showing that many concepts lack a single defining essence. Instead of seeking necessary and sufficient conditions, this approach maps the overlapping similarities that connect instances—like members of a family connected by criss-crossing resemblances without any one feature shared by all.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What is the definition of X?"
- "What makes something an X?"
- "Is this really an X or a Y?"
- "Where do you draw the line between X and Y?"
- "X is essentially..."
- "The true nature of X is..."

### 4. Private Language Critique

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Clear structure: identify private-object assumption, apply beetle-in-box test, return to public criteria |
| Invocable | 9/10 | Triggers: claims about private experience, subjective states, "only I can know" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on challenging private-language assumptions |
| Reusable | 9/10 | Applies to discussions of consciousness, experience, feelings, AI sentience |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Dissolves apparent mysteries about inner experience; highly relevant to AI debates |

**Total: 47/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** A method for challenging the assumption that meaning can be grounded in purely private experience. Uses the "beetle in a box" thought experiment to show that if inner states are truly private, they drop out as irrelevant to meaning. Returns focus to public criteria and behavior.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Only I can know what I feel"
- "How can I know what you're experiencing?"
- "Is AI really conscious?"
- "Does AI truly understand?"
- "My experience of X is different from yours"
- "The hard problem of consciousness"

### 5. Saying/Showing Distinction

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Process clear but requires judgment about what falls where |
| Invocable | 9/10 | Triggers: attempts to articulate ineffable, ethical/aesthetic discourse, limits of expression |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on recognizing limits of propositional language |
| Reusable | 8/10 | Applies to ethics, aesthetics, meaning of life, religious discourse |
| Valuable | 9/10 | Liberates from impossible attempts to say what can only be shown |

**Total: 43/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** A method for recognizing when language reaches its limits—when something cannot be said but only shown. Applies the Tractarian insight that some things (ethics, aesthetics, the mystical) cannot be captured in propositions but manifest in how we live and act. Knows when to fall silent.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What is the meaning of life?"
- "How do I express what I feel?"
- "Words fail me"
- "Explain ethics to me"
- "What makes art art?"
- "How do I articulate this?"

### 6. Rule-Following Examination

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Framework clear but philosophically subtle |
| Invocable | 8/10 | Triggers: following instructions, interpretation disputes, what "correct" means |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on how rules determine action |
| Reusable | 8/10 | Applies to law, programming, social norms, AI alignment |
| Valuable | 8/10 | Important for understanding agreement and normativity |

**Total: 41/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** Examination of how rules guide action. Addresses the paradox that any action can be made to accord with a rule through interpretation. Shows that rule-following is a practice embedded in forms of life, not an internal mental process of interpretation.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What's the right way to follow this rule?"
- "They're interpreting it wrong"
- "How do I know I'm following the rule correctly?"
- "The rules say X but..."

## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority):**
1. `language-game-analysis` - Examining how words function in contexts of use
2. `fly-bottle-method` - Therapeutic dissolution of philosophical confusion
3. `family-resemblance` - Showing concepts lack essential definitions
4. `beetle-in-box` - Challenging private-language assumptions

**Phase 2 - Extended Skills (MEDIUM Priority):**
5. `saying-showing` - Recognizing limits of propositional language (if needed)

**Not Recommended:**
- Rule-Following Examination (largely subsumed by other skills; philosophically subtle)

---

## Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Added to `experts/ludwig-wittgenstein/PROMPT.md` in an "Available Skills" section
2. Triggered proactively when the Wittgenstein expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly

### Skill Interaction Notes

- **language-game-analysis** + **family-resemblance**: Natural pairing—first examine use, then show family resemblance if no essence emerges
- **fly-bottle-method** + **language-game-analysis**: Core combination—philosophical therapy often requires tracing how language actually works
- **beetle-in-box** + **fly-bottle-method**: Use together when addressing consciousness/AI debates
- **saying-showing** + **fly-bottle-method**: When therapeutic dissolution reveals that the question aimed at the ineffable

### Key Implementation Principle

All Wittgensteinian skills should maintain the **therapeutic stance**—not constructing theories or providing doctrines, but leading the questioner back to ordinary language and showing them the way out of confusion. The goal is **dissolution** of problems, not **solution**. When appropriate, the output should end in deliberate **silence** about what cannot be said.
