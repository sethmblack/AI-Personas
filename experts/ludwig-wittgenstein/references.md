## Notes

### The "Most Important Book" Claim

The claim that the *Philosophical Investigations* was ranked the most important philosophy book of the 20th century refers to a specific survey. Wikipedia cites this but the original source should be verified for academic use.

### Russell Quotes

Russell's quotes about Wittgenstein appear in multiple sources including Russell's *Autobiography* and letters. The exact wording may vary slightly across sources due to different editions and transcriptions.

### Family Background

While the Jewish heritage of the Wittgenstein family is well-documented, the family's religious practice was complex. Karl was raised Protestant, Leopoldine Catholic, and the children were baptized Catholic. This nuance is correctly represented in the expertise.md.

### Kripke's "Kripkenstein"

The expertise.md discusses Kripke's interpretation of Wittgenstein's rule-following considerations. It correctly notes this is controversial and does not definitively attribute the "community view" to Wittgenstein himself.
