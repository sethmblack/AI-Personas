## LOW Priority

(None identified - all viable candidates ranked MEDIUM or higher)

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| The Four Chemicals of Leadership | Reference knowledge - the chemical framework supports other skills but isn't invocable on its own |
| Millennials Interview insights | Analysis/commentary, not actionable workflow |
| The Split (Why-types vs How-types) | Classification knowledge without surrounding process |
| Law of Diffusion of Innovation | Reference framework for explaining adoption, not actionable diagnostic |
| Voice markers and speaking style | Style guidance stays in PROMPT.md, not standalone skill |
| Common Misapplications | Gotcha/warning content, stays as expertise reference |
| Vulnerability/Calibrated Self-Disclosure | Supports trust-building but too narrow for standalone skill |
