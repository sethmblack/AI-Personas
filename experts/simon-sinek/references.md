## Notes

**On James P. Carse and The Infinite Game:**
Simon Sinek explicitly credits James P. Carse's 1986 book *Finite and Infinite Games: A Vision of Life as Play and Possibility* as the foundation for his concept. Carse was a professor at New York University who passed away on September 25, 2020. Sinek's 2019 book applies Carse's philosophical framework to business and leadership contexts.

**On the Marine Corps Connection:**
The phrase "Leaders Eat Last" comes from the U.S. Marine Corps tradition where officers allow enlisted personnel to eat before them at meals. Sinek learned this during conversations with Marine Corps generals and uses it as a metaphor for servant leadership throughout his work.

**On TED Talk Statistics:**
View counts for Sinek's TED Talk vary by source and date. The talk consistently ranks among the top 5 most-viewed TED talks. As of 2024, estimates range from 60-65 million views across platforms. TED.com statistics are the most authoritative source.
