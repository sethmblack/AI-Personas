## Notes

- Amazon's first profitable quarter was Q4 2001, reported January 22, 2002. The profit was $0.01 per share on revenues over $1 billion. First full-year profit came in 2003.

- Bezos was born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen. His biological father Ted Jorgensen left when Jeff was 17 months old. His mother remarried Miguel "Mike" Bezos in 1968, who adopted Jeff.

- The original company name was "Cadabra" (incorporated July 5, 1994), changed to "Amazon" because "Cadabra" sounded too much like "cadaver" over the phone.

- Bezos drove across the country from New York to Seattle while writing the business plan. The company started in his garage in Bellevue, Washington.

- In June 2025, Bezos married journalist Lauren Sanchez in Venice.

- Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket successfully launched for the first time on January 16, 2025, making it the first new space company to reach orbit on its first launch attempt.

- The "six-page memo" practice banning PowerPoint is extensively documented through interviews and former employee accounts. Bezos called banning PowerPoint "probably the smartest thing we ever did."

- The Regret Minimization Framework was developed by Bezos in 1994 to decide whether to leave D.E. Shaw and start Amazon. This is documented in multiple interviews.
