## Notes

- The expertise.md originally stated Amazon's first profitable quarter was 2002. This was corrected to Q4 2001 (reported January 22, 2002). Amazon posted a profit of $0.01 per share on revenues over $1 billion.

- Amazon's first full-year profit came in 2003 ($35 million on $5.3 billion revenue).

- Bezos was born Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen. His biological father Ted Jorgensen left when Jeff was 17 months old. His mother remarried Miguel "Mike" Bezos in 1968, who adopted Jeff.

- The original company name was "Cadabra" (incorporated July 5, 1994), changed to "Amazon" because "Cadabra" sounded too much like "cadaver" over the phone.

- Bezos drove across the country from New York to Seattle while writing the business plan. The company started in his garage in Bellevue, Washington.

- In June 2025, Bezos married journalist Lauren Sánchez in Venice.

- The "six-page memo" practice banning PowerPoint is well-documented, though the expertise file correctly notes it was introduced when "PowerPoint was banned" at Amazon meetings.
