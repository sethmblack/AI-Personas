## HIGH Priority

### 1. working-backwards-prfaq

**Source Pattern:** Working Backwards / PR-FAQ Methodology
**Purpose:** Structure new product or feature thinking by writing the press release and FAQ before building anything, ensuring customer-centric clarity.
**Trigger:** "Should we build this?" or "New product idea" or "Help me think through this feature" or "Write a PR-FAQ"
**Inputs:** Product/feature concept, target customer, problem being solved, proposed solution
**Outputs:** Structured press release (headline, problem, solution, quotes), external FAQ, internal FAQ, go/no-go recommendation

**Reasoning:** This is Bezos's signature methodology. Highly actionable with a clear structure. Forces rigorous thinking about customer value before investment. Widely applicable to any new product, feature, or initiative. Prevents the common error of building before validating.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 10/10 - Explicit template with defined sections
- Invocable: 10/10 - Natural triggers around product planning
- Scoped: 9/10 - Clear boundary (new products/features, not operations)
- Reusable: 10/10 - Products, features, services, initiatives
- Valuable: 10/10 - Prevents costly build-before-validate mistakes

**Score: 49/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

### 2. day-1-diagnostic

**Source Pattern:** Day 1 vs Day 2 Philosophy / Day 1 Defense
**Purpose:** Assess whether an organization (or team) has slipped into Day 2 thinking and identify specific remedies.
**Trigger:** "Why are we so slow?" or "We've become bureaucratic" or "Diagnose our organization" or "Are we Day 1 or Day 2?"
**Inputs:** Description of organization, decision-making patterns, customer relationship, process descriptions
**Outputs:** Day 1/Day 2 assessment across four dimensions (customer obsession, proxy management, trend adoption, decision velocity), specific symptoms identified, remediation recommendations

**Reasoning:** The Day 1 framework provides clear diagnostic criteria. Four specific dimensions to evaluate. Applicable to any organization, team, or even individual. Identifies root causes of organizational slowdown.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9/10 - Four clear dimensions to evaluate
- Invocable: 10/10 - "Why are we slow?" is a common question
- Scoped: 9/10 - Organizational health, not product decisions
- Reusable: 10/10 - Any company, team, or initiative
- Valuable: 10/10 - Diagnoses silent killers of innovation

**Score: 48/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

### 3. decision-type-classifier

**Source Pattern:** Type 1 vs Type 2 Decisions (One-Way vs Two-Way Doors)
**Purpose:** Classify decisions by reversibility and recommend the appropriate decision-making process for each.
**Trigger:** "How should we decide this?" or "We're stuck in analysis paralysis" or "Is this a big decision or small one?" or "Type 1 or Type 2?"
**Inputs:** Decision description, stakes involved, reversibility assessment, time pressure
**Outputs:** Decision type classification, recommended process (deliberate vs. fast), decision-makers to involve, information threshold (70% rule application)

**Reasoning:** Simple but powerful framework. Directly addresses common organizational dysfunction (treating all decisions as Type 1). Clear binary classification with distinct process recommendations. Applicable to any decision context.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 10/10 - Clear binary classification with distinct processes
- Invocable: 10/10 - Decision-making questions are universal
- Scoped: 10/10 - Decision process, not the decision itself
- Reusable: 10/10 - Any decision in any context
- Valuable: 9/10 - Accelerates decision-making, reduces paralysis

**Score: 49/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

### 4. flywheel-design

**Source Pattern:** The Flywheel / Virtuous Cycle
**Purpose:** Design self-reinforcing growth cycles where each element feeds the next, creating compounding advantages.
**Trigger:** "How do we scale?" or "Design a business model" or "What's our growth engine?" or "Create a flywheel"
**Inputs:** Business model components, customer value proposition, key activities, cost structure
**Outputs:** Flywheel diagram showing reinforcing elements, momentum analysis, investment priorities, potential failure points

**Reasoning:** Bezos's famous napkin sketch created enormous value. The flywheel concept is highly teachable and applicable. Forces systems thinking about how elements reinforce each other. Applicable to business models, product ecosystems, and growth strategies.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9/10 - Clear elements to identify and connect
- Invocable: 9/10 - Business model and growth questions
- Scoped: 9/10 - Business model design, not execution
- Reusable: 10/10 - Any business, product ecosystem, or growth initiative
- Valuable: 10/10 - Creates compounding strategic advantages

**Score: 47/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. regret-minimization-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Regret Minimization Framework
**Purpose:** Evaluate major life/career decisions by projecting to age 80 and minimizing lifetime regrets about inaction.
**Trigger:** "Should I take this risk?" or "Major career decision" or "I'm afraid to try" or "Regret minimization"
**Inputs:** Decision description, options, fears, potential outcomes
**Outputs:** Regret analysis (action vs. inaction scenarios), long-term perspective reframe, recommendation

**Reasoning:** Powerful personal decision framework. Simple but requires honest self-reflection. More personal than organizational - narrower application than other skills. Highly valuable for career and major life decisions.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 8/10 - Clear but requires honest self-assessment
- Invocable: 9/10 - Career and major life decisions
- Scoped: 10/10 - Major personal decisions only
- Reusable: 8/10 - Personal decisions, less organizational
- Valuable: 9/10 - Clarifies major life choices

**Score: 44/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM** (borderline HIGH - personal vs. professional scope)

### 6. six-page-narrative-structure

**Source Pattern:** The Six-Page Memo / Narrative Requirement
**Purpose:** Structure complex proposals and decisions using narrative instead of bullet points, forcing complete thinking.
**Trigger:** "Help me write this proposal" or "Structure this document" or "Turn this into a narrative"
**Inputs:** Topic, key points, supporting data, recommendations
**Outputs:** Six-page narrative structure (introduction, goals, tenets, state of business, lessons learned, strategic priorities), writing guidance

**Reasoning:** Valuable methodology but more about format than strategic thinking. The structure is clear but the value comes from the thinking it forces, not the structure itself. Useful but less distinctive than other Bezos frameworks.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9/10 - Clear six-section structure
- Invocable: 8/10 - Document and proposal requests
- Scoped: 9/10 - Document structure, not strategy
- Reusable: 8/10 - Proposals, planning documents
- Valuable: 7/10 - Forces thinking but less distinctive impact

**Score: 41/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**
