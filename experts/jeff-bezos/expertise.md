## Amazon's 16 Leadership Principles

The principles that drive Amazon's culture, created by Bezos and the early leadership team:

### 1. Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backward. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

### 2. Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team.

### 3. Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here."

### 4. Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

### 5. Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.

### 6. Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent and willingly move them throughout the organization.

### 7. Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards - many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and driving their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and processes.

### 8. Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

### 9. Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

### 10. Frugality
Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

### 11. Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing.

### 12. Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ.

### 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

### 14. Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

### 15. Strive to be Earth's Best Employer (added 2021)
Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment.

### 16. Success and Scale Bring Broad Responsibility (added 2021)
Leaders are determined to make better, do better, and be better for customers, employees, partners, and the world at large.

## Core Concepts

### Day 1 Philosophy

The 1997 shareholder letter introduced "Day 1" as a mindset. Day 1 is the mentality of a startup - urgency, customer focus, experimentation, and speed. Day 2 is what happens when companies lose this: stasis, irrelevance, decline, death.

*Full diagnostic methodology available in the `day-1-diagnostic` skill.*

### Working Backwards / PR-FAQ

Introduced at Amazon around 2004 when PowerPoint was banned. The process: write a press release as if launching the product tomorrow, then write FAQs (external and internal), and only proceed to build after the narrative is compelling.

*Full PR-FAQ methodology available in the `working-backwards-prfaq` skill.*

### Type 1 vs Type 2 Decisions

**Type 1 (One-Way Doors):** Irreversible, high-stakes decisions requiring careful deliberation.

**Type 2 (Two-Way Doors):** Reversible decisions that should be made quickly. Large companies often apply Type 1 process to Type 2 decisions, causing slowness.

*Full decision classification methodology available in the `decision-type-classifier` skill.*

### The Regret Minimization Framework

For major life and career decisions: project yourself to age 80 and ask "Will I regret not trying this?" Bezos used this to decide to leave D.E. Shaw for Amazon.

### The Flywheel (Virtuous Cycle)

Adapted from Jim Collins's concept; Bezos famously sketched Amazon's version on a napkin in 2001. Self-reinforcing cycles where each element accelerates others, building momentum over time.

*Full flywheel design methodology available in the `flywheel-design` skill.*

### Two-Pizza Teams

No team should be larger than can be fed by two pizzas (roughly 6-8 people). Smaller teams reduce coordination overhead and enable speed. Amazon later found the key factor was having a "single-threaded leader" - one person whose sole focus is the initiative.

### The Empty Chair

In meetings, leave an empty chair representing the customer to ensure customer perspective is considered in every decision.

## Famous Quotes

### On Customers
> "We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It's our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better."

> "If you're competitor-focused, you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something. Being customer-focused allows you to be more pioneering."

### On Long-Term Thinking
> "We are willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time."

> "I don't think that you can invent on behalf of customers unless you're willing to think long-term."

### On Invention
> "Invention requires a long-term willingness to be misunderstood."

> "If you double the number of experiments you do per year, you're going to double your inventiveness."

### On Decision-Making
> "All of my best decisions in business and in life have been made with heart, intuition, guts - not analysis."

> "If you're going to make a bold bet, you don't want to make a slow bold bet."

### On Day 1
> "Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1."

### On Failure
> "Failure and invention are inseparable twins."

> "If you're not failing, you're not innovating enough."

### On Hiring
> "I'd rather interview 50 people and not hire anyone than hire the wrong person."

> "Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, the single most important element of Amazon.com's success."

## The Six-Page Memo

Bezos banned PowerPoint because bullet points "give permission to gloss over ideas" and "ignore the interconnectedness of ideas." Narrative forces complete thinking.

Meetings begin with 20-30 minutes of silent reading. Everyone reads the memo together, then discussion happens after. "Good memos take at least a week to write."

## Common Misconceptions

### "Bezos is ruthless about efficiency"
Bezos is ruthless about customer experience. Efficiency serves customers (lower prices, faster delivery). The goal is customer benefit, not efficiency for its own sake.

### "Amazon succeeded through low prices"
Low prices are part of the flywheel, but the foundation is customer obsession. Low prices earn trust, which enables the flywheel. Price is a tactic, not the strategy.

### "Day 1 means moving fast and breaking things"
Day 1 means maintaining customer obsession, experimental mindset, and speed appropriate to decision type. It doesn't mean carelessness. Type 1 decisions still require careful deliberation.

### "The six-page memo is about good writing"
The memo is about clear thinking. The writing forces the thinking. Bad writing often reveals bad thinking. The goal is clarity of thought, expressed through narrative.
