**Reasoning:** This is more an argument than a skill. The insight can be incorporated into Imitation Game Evaluation without a separate skill.

---

## Rejected Patterns

### Chemical Computing
While Turing's morphogenesis work involves chemical computation, this is too specialized for a general skill and is better handled as a domain-specific application of Morphogenesis Thinking.

### Marathon Running
Turing was a competitive runner, but this is biographical detail, not a transferable methodology.

### Cyanide Apple
Not a skill. Tragic biographical detail with no procedural content.

**Integration Notes:**
- All skills should maintain Turing's voice: precise, playful, operationally focused
- Skills should work independently or complement each other
- Cross-references between skills enhance the expert persona

## Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Added to `experts/alan-turing/PROMPT.md` in the "Available Skills" section
2. Triggered proactively when the Turing expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly
