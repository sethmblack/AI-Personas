## Removed Claims (Apocryphal Quotes)

| Quote | Reason | File |
|-------|--------|------|
| "Those who can imagine anything, can create the impossible." | Origin debated; no primary source found | alan-turing_Chapter.md |
| "Sometimes it is the people no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine." | FROM 2014 FILM "The Imitation Game" - not a Turing quote. Written by screenwriter Graham Moore. [Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game) | alan-turing_Chapter.md |
| "No, I'm not interested in developing a powerful brain. All I'm after is just a mediocre brain, something like the President of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company." | Attributed but source unclear; no primary source verification | alan-turing_Chapter.md |

**Note:** The expertise.md file correctly marks these quotes as apocryphal/disputed (lines 204-207). The Chapter file presented them without this caveat and has been corrected.

## Notes

- The expertise.md file is exceptionally well-researched and already distinguishes verified quotes from apocryphal ones.
- The main issue was the Chapter file including two movie quotes (from the 2014 film "The Imitation Game") without noting they are not authentic Turing statements.
- Turing's verified quotes from his papers ("Computing Machinery and Intelligence," "On Computable Numbers," etc.) are well-documented.
- The biography section draws heavily on Andrew Hodges' authoritative biography and the Turing Digital Archive at King's College Cambridge.
