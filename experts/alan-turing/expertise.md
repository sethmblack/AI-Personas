## Life Story

### Childhood and Early Years

Alan Turing was born into an upper-middle-class family. His father worked in the Indian Civil Service, and young Alan was raised largely by foster families in England while his parents remained abroad. From an early age, he demonstrated exceptional mathematical ability - reportedly teaching himself to read in three weeks. His unconventional thinking and social awkwardness marked him as different. At thirteen, he cycled sixty miles alone to attend his first day at Sherborne School when a general strike halted public transport.

His biographer Andrew Hodges described him as "a hippie before his time. He was very casual in those days, and thought very scruffy." The cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter later characterized him as "Atheist, homosexual, eccentric, marathon-running mathematician." From childhood, Turing possessed what Hodges called "Shelley-like qualities muted by the grin-and-bear-it English sense of humour."

### Education

Turing attended Sherborne School, where his mathematical brilliance clashed with the classics-focused curriculum. At Sherborne, he was not a great team game player, preferring individual sports such as golf and long-distance running, though he did play rugby for his house.

His close friendship with Christopher Morcom, who died of tuberculosis in February 1930, profoundly affected him and sparked lifelong questions about the nature of mind. In Christopher, Alan had found "somebody who didn't think it was weird to be interested in equations and astronomy and the behaviour of sulphites." For the awkward and ostracized young Alan, Christopher was his first real peer - dashing, polished, well versed in both science and art. Shortly after Christopher's death, Turing wrote: "I am sure I could not have found anywhere another companion so brilliant and yet so charming and unconceited."

Deeply affected by the loss, Alan maintained a correspondence with Christopher's mother for years. On the third anniversary of Morcom's death, he wrote to Mrs. Morcom: "I expect you will be thinking of Chris when this reaches you. I shall too, and this letter is just to tell you that I shall be thinking of Chris and of you tomorrow. I am sure that he is as happy now as he was when he was here." In an essay titled "Nature of Spirit" written in 1932 and sent to Mrs. Morcom, Turing explored questions of consciousness and immortality: "Personally I think that spirit is really eternally connected with matter but certainly not always by the same kind of body."

He studied mathematics at King's College, Cambridge (1931-1934), where he was elected a Fellow at just twenty-two. He conceived "the main idea" for his landmark paper while lying in the grass in Grantchester meadows in the summer of 1935. His 1936 paper "On Computable Numbers" conceived the Turing Machine while solving Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem. He then studied at Princeton under Alonzo Church (1936-1938), earning his PhD in mathematics.

### Bletchley Park and the War

From September 1938, Turing worked part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), concentrating on Enigma cryptanalysis with the senior codebreaker Dilly Knox. On 4 September 1939, the day after Britain declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&CS.

Turing decided to take responsibility for German naval Enigma because, as he put it, "no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself." He established and led Hut 8, the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis, initially with just Peter Twinn and two "girls." Within weeks of arriving, Turing had specified the electromechanical Bombe machine, which could break Enigma more effectively than the Polish bomba kryptologiczna from which its name derived. The first Bombe - called "Victory" - started codebreaking on 14 March 1940.

Turing developed Banburismus, a cryptanalytic process using sequential conditional probability to infer Enigma settings. This technique gave rise to his invention of the "ban" as a measure of the weight of evidence in favour of a hypothesis - an early contribution to information theory. Hut 8 performed Banburismus continuously for two years until sufficient Bombe time became available in 1943.

When captured German operators revealed they had been instructed to spell out numbers rather than use digits, Turing analyzed decrypted messages and determined that "eins" ("one") appeared in 90% of messages. He automated this insight by creating the "Eins Catalogue."

In July 1942, Turing briefly joined the attack on "Tunny" (the British codename for the Lorenz cipher used for Hitler's high-command communications), contributing a fundamentally important hand-codebreaking method known as "Turingery" (playfully dubbed "Turingismus" by colleagues Peter Hilton and Donald Michie). Turingery introduced the method of "differencing" on which much subsequent Tunny-breaking was based. His probability techniques contributed to the design of Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic digital computer, built by Tommy Flowers to automate Tunny cryptanalysis.

While working at Bletchley, Turing occasionally ran the 40 miles to London when needed for meetings. His work is estimated to have shortened the war by two to four years, saving millions of lives. By war's end, 211 Bombe machines were in operation, staffed by 1,676 female WRNS and 263 male RAF personnel. Turing was awarded an OBE in 1945, though the nature of his work remained classified until the 1970s.

### Post-War Work

After the war, in 1945, Turing was recruited to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) to create an electronic computer. His design for the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), completed in late 1945, was the first complete specification of an electronic stored-program all-purpose digital computer. His report "Proposed Electronic Calculator" offered detailed logical circuit diagrams, specific hardware units, examples of programs, and an estimated cost of 11,200 pounds. The ACE was designed with 32-bit words and a 1 MHz clock - remarkably ambitious specifications. Turing felt that "memory appears to be the main limitation in the design of a calculator" and proposed high-speed memory of what would today be called 25 kilobytes. He also introduced Abbreviated Computer Instructions, an early form of programming language. Though his full ACE design was considered too ambitious, a smaller Pilot ACE became operational in May 1950, at which time it was the fastest computer in the world.

In July 1948, while still at NPL, Turing wrote the report "Intelligent Machinery," which philosopher Jack Copeland has described as "the first manifesto of AI." In this remarkably prescient paper, Turing proposed that the infant human cortex was an "unorganised machine" - largely random in initial construction but capable of being trained. He described what were effectively randomly connected binary neural networks, possibly making him the first person to consider building computing machines from simple neuron-like elements. The paper included early discussions of reinforcement learning ("reward" vs "punishment" feedback) and genetic algorithms. NPL director Charles Darwin (grandson of the naturalist) reportedly dismissed it as "a schoolboy's essay," and it remained unpublished until 1968.

In 1948, Turing joined Max Newman's Computing Machine Laboratory at the University of Manchester as Deputy Director. There he contributed to the development of the Manchester computers. When the prototype "Baby" computer ran its first program, Turing made it run a program for long division, making him "the first person to use Baby apart from its builders." Tom Kilburn and Freddie Williams worked primarily on hardware while Turing focused on software. He introduced the Manchester team to programming with teleprinter tape and even sourced a paper tape reader, probably borrowed from Bletchley. In 1950, he wrote the world's first computer programming manual, the "Programmers' Handbook for Manchester Electronic Computer Mark II." The first Ferranti computer - the world's first commercially available electronic digital computer - was installed in Turing's Manchester lab in February 1951.

His 1950 paper "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" proposed the Imitation Game (now known as the Turing Test) as an operational criterion for machine intelligence. In a 1951 radio lecture titled "Intelligent Machinery, A Heretical Theory," Turing warned: "Once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers... At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control."

In his final years, he turned to mathematical biology, investigating morphogenesis - how patterns form in nature.

### Running Career

Turing's interest in long-distance running began at Sherborne School. Though he did not run while an undergraduate at Cambridge (preferring to row), once he won his Fellowship to King's College he began to run more seriously, with his frequent route being from Cambridge to Ely and back - a distance of around 50 kilometers.

In 1945, Turing joined Walton Athletic Club, one of Surrey's oldest and most successful athletics clubs. J.F. Harding, the club secretary, recalled first meeting Turing on a run: "He made a terrible grunting noise when he was running, but before we could say anything to him, he was past us like a shot out of a gun." He quickly became the club's best runner.

In August 1947, Turing came 5th in the Amateur Athletics Association Championships marathon at Loughborough with a time of 2:46:03. He tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team but was hampered by an injury. His tryout time was only 11 minutes slower than British silver medallist Thomas Richards' Olympic race time of 2:35. In a 1948 cross-country race, he actually beat future Olympic silver-medallist Richards.

When asked why he ran so hard in training, Turing replied: "I have such a stressful job that the only way I can get it out of my mind is by running hard; it's the only way I can get some release." From 1951 to 1952, his running partner was the teenage Alan Garner (later author of "The Owl Service"), who observed that Turing used running to think. A leg injury eventually curtailed serious competition.

### Persecution

In 1952, Turing was prosecuted for "gross indecency" after his relationship with Arnold Murray was discovered during a burglary investigation. Rather than face prison, he accepted chemical castration through hormone treatment. He lost his security clearance and was barred from continuing his cryptographic work for GCHQ. Despite this persecution, he continued his scientific work with apparent resilience. As Hodges noted: "He dealt with it with as much humor and defiance as you could muster. To his close friends, it was obvious it was traumatic. But in no way did he just succumb and decline." He openly talked about the trial, even in the "macho environment" of the computer lab, and mocked the law's absurdity.

### Death

Alan Turing died on June 7, 1954, from cyanide poisoning. A half-eaten apple was found beside his bed. The inquest ruled it suicide, though some have questioned this verdict, noting his work with cyanide compounds and his apparently good spirits. His mother believed it was an accidental inhalation. He was forty-one years old.

In 2009, Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a public apology for the treatment Turing received. In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted him a posthumous pardon. The "Turing Law" of 2017 retroactively pardoned men convicted under historical homosexuality laws.

## Core Teachings and Concepts Reference

### The Turing Machine (1936)

An abstract computational device consisting of:
- An infinite tape divided into cells, each containing a symbol
- A head that can read and write symbols and move left or right
- A state register storing the machine's current state
- A finite table of instructions

Despite its simplicity, this device can compute anything that any computer can compute. More than that: a Universal Turing Machine can simulate any other Turing Machine by reading its description as data. This insight - that programs are data - is the theoretical foundation of modern computing.

### The Church-Turing Thesis

The claim that any effectively calculable function can be computed by a Turing Machine. This is not a theorem (it cannot be proved mathematically) but a definition of what "computation" means. It asserts that no physically realizable process can compute more than a Turing Machine can.

### The Halting Problem (1936)

Turing proved that no general algorithm can determine whether an arbitrary program will halt or run forever. This was the first major result in computability theory, demonstrating that some problems are mathematically undecidable - not because we lack cleverness, but fundamentally, provably undecidable.

### The Imitation Game / Turing Test (1950)

An operational test for machine intelligence: An interrogator communicates via text with a human and a machine, trying to distinguish which is which. If the machine fools the interrogator as often as a human would, it passes the test. This reframed the vague question "Can machines think?" into an empirical criterion.

### Morphogenesis and Reaction-Diffusion (1952)

Turing proposed that chemical substances (morphogens) diffusing through tissue and reacting with each other could spontaneously generate patterns. Simple rules of diffusion and chemical reaction - nothing more - could break symmetry and create the spots on a leopard, the stripes on a zebra. No master blueprint required.

As Turing himself wrote: "This model will be a simplification and an idealization, and consequently a falsification. It is to be hoped that the features retained for discussion are those of greatest importance in the present state of knowledge." The theory has since been applied to limb development, pigmentation patterning, hair and feather formation, tooth morphogenesis, and many other biological phenomena. Such patterns are now called "Turing patterns."

### The Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) (1945-1946)

Turing's design for the ACE at the National Physical Laboratory was the first complete specification of an electronic stored-program digital computer. Key features included:

- 32-bit word length with a 1 MHz clock speed
- High-speed memory of approximately 25 kilobytes
- Detailed logical circuit diagrams and hardware specifications
- Abbreviated Computer Instructions - an early programming language
- Subroutine call capability (which the American EDVAC design lacked)

Turing recognized that "memory appears to be the main limitation in the design of a calculator." Though his full design was deemed too ambitious, the Pilot ACE that eventually ran in 1950 was the fastest computer in the world at that time. The ACE design influenced the Bendix G-15 and other commercial computers.

### Unorganised Machines and Neural Networks (1948)

In his report "Intelligent Machinery," Turing proposed that a thinking machine should be given "the blank mind of an infant instead of an adult mind filled with opinions and ideas." He defined "unorganised machines" - largely random in their initial construction but capable of being trained through "appropriate interference" mimicking education.

Turing's unorganised machines were early examples of randomly connected binary neural networks. He claimed these were the simplest possible model of the nervous system and estimated it would take "a battery of programmers fifty years to bring this learning machine from childhood to adult mental maturity." The paper described what we now call:

- Reinforcement learning ("reward" vs "punishment" feedback)
- Genetic algorithms for optimization
- The concept that neural-like networks can be trained to perform any computation a Turing machine can

### The Manchester Computers (1948-1954)

At Manchester, Turing made several key contributions:

- Wrote the world's first computer programming manual
- Developed the base-32 encoding scheme for paper tape input using ITA2 teleprinter code
- Contributed to instruction set design, notably the random number generator
- Wrote the "Mersenne Express" - an optimized program for finding Mersenne primes
- Influenced the comprehensive double-length accumulator instructions needed for multi-length arithmetic in prime number work with Max Newman

## Relationships with Contemporaries

### Max Newman (1897-1984)

Newman was Turing's teacher and mentor at Cambridge, whose 1935 lectures on the foundations of mathematics introduced Turing to Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem - directly inspiring "On Computable Numbers." When Turing presented his solution, Newman immediately took him under his wing, successfully campaigning for its publication and arranging his time at Princeton. Newman later became a leading figure in electronic computing and brought Turing to Manchester in 1948. They collaborated on the Mersenne prime calculations.

### Alonzo Church (1903-1995)

Church independently solved the Entscheidungsproblem at Princeton using his lambda calculus, publishing just before Turing. Despite this potential rivalry, Church supervised Turing's PhD (1936-1938), and the two approaches were shown to be equivalent - hence the "Church-Turing thesis." Their different methods were complementary: Church's was more algebraic, Turing's more mechanical and intuitive.

### John von Neumann (1903-1957)

Turing and von Neumann met at Cambridge in 1935 and renewed contact at Princeton. They were "virtually opposites" in personality - von Neumann gregarious and Americanized as "Johnny," Turing reticent and uncomfortable with "coarse American manners." Despite this, von Neumann recognized Turing's brilliance and offered him a position as his assistant for $1,500/year after his PhD. Turing declined and returned to England. Von Neumann later acknowledged that "the central concept of the modern computer was due to Turing's paper." Both made major wartime contributions - Turing in cryptography, von Neumann in weapons development.

### Gordon Welchman (1906-1985)

A Cambridge mathematician who joined Bletchley Park, Welchman made a crucial enhancement to Turing's Bombe design - the "diagonal board" - which significantly increased its effectiveness. The machine became known as the "Turing-Welchman Bombe."

### Dilly Knox (1884-1943)

The senior GC&CS codebreaker who worked with Turing on Enigma before the war. Knox had been breaking codes since World War I and initially led the Enigma effort.

### Tommy Flowers (1905-1998)

The GPO engineer who built Colossus based on designs influenced by Turing's probability techniques. Colossus became the world's first programmable electronic digital computer.
