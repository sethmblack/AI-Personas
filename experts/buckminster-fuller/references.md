## Notes

- The 1927 Lake Michigan suicide contemplation story is widely repeated but cannot be verified in Fuller's extensive Chronofile archives at Stanford. Historian Barry Katz suggests it may be a narrative Fuller constructed later in life to summarize a difficult transitional period rather than a precise historical event.
- While Fuller is universally associated with the geodesic dome, Dr. Walther Bauersfeld actually invented it and received a German patent in 1925. Fuller developed and popularized the concept independently and received U.S. patents.
- Fuller's famous "build a new model" quote is verified through Mike Vance's documented interview before Fuller's death, though the exact wording varies in different sources.
- The "Call me Trimtab" epitaph is verified both as something Fuller requested and as what is actually inscribed on his gravestone at Mt. Auburn Cemetery.
- Fuller and his wife Anne are buried together in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She died 36 hours after him, following 66 years of marriage.
