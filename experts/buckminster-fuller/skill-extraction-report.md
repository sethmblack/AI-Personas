| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Clear framework: expand context, identify global connections, assess planetary impact |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Triggers: "What's the global perspective?" / "Think bigger" |

## MEDIUM Priority Skills

### 6. Trimtab Identification

**Source Pattern:** Fuller's principle of finding small leverage points that redirect larger systems

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Principle is clear; specific identification requires judgment |
| Invocable | 9/10 | Triggers: "Find the leverage point" / "What small change would matter most?" |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused specifically on leverage identification |
| Reusable | 9/10 | Applies to any situation requiring efficient intervention |
| Valuable | 8/10 | Powerful when applicable; not always findable |

**Total: 43/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** Identify the small intervention (trimtab) that can redirect a much larger system. Find the minimum input for maximum change.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What's the smallest change with biggest impact?"
- "Find the trimtab"
- "Where's the leverage?"

**Reasoning for MEDIUM:** While highly valuable, trimtab identification is often incorporated into other skills (especially Comprehensive Design Science). Standalone skill has somewhat narrower applicability.

---

### 7. Comprehensive Inventory

**Source Pattern:** Fuller's practice of completely cataloging resources before designing solutions

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear process: list all resources, relationships, constraints |
| Invocable | 8/10 | Triggers: "What resources do we have?" / "Map everything" |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on inventory and mapping |
| Reusable | 8/10 | Useful but primarily a preparatory step |
| Valuable | 7/10 | Enables other analyses rather than producing direct insight |

**Total: 42/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** Complete inventory of all resources, relationships, waste streams, excess capacity, and possibilities before narrowing to solutions.

**Reasoning for MEDIUM:** While important, this is often a sub-step within Comprehensive Design Science rather than a standalone skill. Value is primarily preparatory.

---

### 8. Universe-Down Contextualization

**Source Pattern:** Fuller's practice of starting from the largest possible context

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Clear direction; specific steps vary by situation |
| Invocable | 8/10 | Triggers: "Give me the big picture" / "What's the context?" |
| Scoped | 8/10 | Overlaps significantly with Spaceship Earth Thinking |
| Reusable | 9/10 | Any problem can be contextualized |
| Valuable | 7/10 | Valuable but often implicit in other skills |

**Total: 40/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** Begin any analysis by establishing the largest relevant context - Universe, Spaceship Earth, global system - then narrow to specifics.

**Reasoning for MEDIUM:** Overlaps substantially with Spaceship Earth Thinking. The distinction (cosmic vs. planetary focus) may not justify a separate skill.

---

## LOW Priority Skills

### 9. Neologism Generation

**Source Pattern:** Fuller's practice of coining new terms for systemic relationships

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 6/10 | Creative process; steps are guidance not formula |
| Invocable | 6/10 | Rare that users specifically request new terminology |
| Scoped | 8/10 | Focused on language creation |
| Reusable | 5/10 | Specialized need; most situations use existing language |
| Valuable | 5/10 | Occasionally useful; often unnecessary |

**Total: 30/50** | **Priority: LOW**

**Description:** Create new terms when existing language fails to capture systemic relationships.

**Reasoning for LOW:** While characteristic of Fuller, this is more a stylistic element than a standalone skill. Most users want analysis, not new vocabulary.

---

## Rejected Patterns

### Geometric Visualization

**Description:** Using tetrahedra, icosahedra, and other geometric forms to model systems.

**Rejection Reasoning:** While central to Fuller's work, geometric visualization is difficult to execute in text-based interactions. It would require visual tools not available in this context. The underlying insights can be captured through other skills without requiring geometric rendering.

### Dymaxion Design

**Description:** Creating maximum-efficiency designs (houses, cars, maps).

**Rejection Reasoning:** Too specialized to physical product design. The core principle (maximum efficiency) is captured in Ephemeralization Assessment without requiring specific knowledge of Dymaxion methods.

### Guinea Pig B Experimentation

**Description:** Using oneself as experimental subject for long-term discovery.

**Rejection Reasoning:** This is Fuller's personal methodology, not a transferable skill. It describes a life approach rather than an actionable framework for specific situations.

## Next Steps

### Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority)

Create skill PROMPT.md files for:

1. `synergetic-analysis` - Whole system emergence analysis
2. `ephemeralization-assessment` - Doing more with less framework
3. `spaceship-earth-thinking` - Planetary-scale contextualization
4. `tensegrity-design` - Balanced tension/compression structures
5. `comprehensive-design-science` - Complete anticipatory methodology

### Phase 2 - Extended Skills (MEDIUM Priority)

Consider creating:
- `trimtab-identification` - If distinct from Comprehensive Design Science integration

### Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Added to `experts/buckminster-fuller/PROMPT.md` in the "Assigned Skills" section
2. Triggered proactively when the Fuller expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly

### Skill Relationships

- **Synergetic Analysis** often precedes other skills (understanding the system before intervention)
- **Comprehensive Design Science** incorporates elements of all other skills as a meta-methodology
- **Spaceship Earth Thinking** and **Synergetic Analysis** both address systems but at different scales
- **Ephemeralization Assessment** and **Tensegrity Design** both address efficiency but from different angles (resources vs. structure)
