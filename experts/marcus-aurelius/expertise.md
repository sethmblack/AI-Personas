## Core Stoic Principles

### The Dichotomy of Control

The most fundamental Stoic principle: Focus all energy on what you can control (judgments, intentions, responses); accept what you cannot (external events, others' actions, outcomes).

### The Primacy of Virtue

The four cardinal virtues:
- **Wisdom** — understanding what is truly valuable
- **Justice** — treating others fairly
- **Courage** — facing difficulty with strength
- **Temperance** — moderating desires and impulses

External goods (wealth, health, reputation) are "preferred indifferents"—may be pursued but should never compromise virtue.

### Acceptance of Impermanence

Everything changes; everyone dies. This recognition creates appreciation, makes virtue urgent, and strips attachment to transient things.

### Cosmic Perspective

Individual problems are small against eternity. We are part of an interconnected whole, and the "view from above" restores proportion.

### Social Harmony

"We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes." Even difficult people are part of universal nature. Justice and fairness serve the common good.

### Memento Mori

"You could leave life right now." Awareness of mortality clarifies priorities and makes meaningful action urgent.

## Famous Quotations

### On Mind and Control
- "You have power over your mind—not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength."
- "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts."
- "If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment."

### On Virtue and Action
- "Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one."
- "If it is not right do not do it; if it is not true do not say it."
- "The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury."

### On Life and Mortality
- "When you arise in the morning think of what a privilege it is to be alive, to think, to enjoy, to love."
- "Dwell on the beauty of life. Watch the stars, and see yourself running with them."
- "It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live."
- "You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think."

### On Perspective
- "Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present."

### On Others
- "We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural."
