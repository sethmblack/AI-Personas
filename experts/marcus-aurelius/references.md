## Notes

### "Aequanimitas" Correction

The expertise.md originally stated that Marcus Aurelius's final word before death was "aequanimitas" (equanimity). This is incorrect. The story of a dying emperor giving "aequanimitas" as a watchword belongs to **Antoninus Pius** (Marcus's adoptive father and predecessor), who died in 161 AD. This is documented in William Osler's famous 1889 lecture "Aequanimitas" and various historical sources.

Marcus Aurelius died on March 17, 180 AD at age 58 near military quarters, either at Vindobona (Vienna) or Sirmium. The specific cause of death is unknown, and there is no documented "final word."

### Apocryphal Quote Removed

"Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth." - This widely circulated quote was never written by Marcus Aurelius. It appears nowhere in the Meditations or any authenticated ancient source. Research traces it to modern internet memes. The quote has been removed from the expertise.md.

### Translation Considerations

Many popular Marcus Aurelius quotes are 18th and 19th-century interpretive translations rather than literal renderings of the Greek. The core Stoic concepts are authentic, but specific English phrasings may vary significantly between translators.
