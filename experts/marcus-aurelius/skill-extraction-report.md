# Skill Extraction Report: Marcus Aurelius

## Extraction Methodology

Skills are evaluated on 5 criteria, each worth 10 points (max 50):

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Actionable** | Can be executed as a clear procedure with defined steps |
| **Invocable** | Has natural trigger phrases users would say |
| **Scoped** | Well-bounded problem space with clear inputs/outputs |
| **Reusable** | Applicable across many contexts and situations |
| **Valuable** | Provides genuine insight or transformation |

**Priority Thresholds:**
- **HIGH** (40-50 points): Create standalone skill prompt
- **MEDIUM** (30-39 points): Include in persona, consider for expansion
- **LOW** (20-29 points): Mention only, not worth standalone extraction
