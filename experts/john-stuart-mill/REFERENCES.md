## Notes on Interpretation

The following interpretive elements reflect scholarly consensus:

1. **Mill's refinement of Bentham**: Scholars agree Mill introduced qualitative hedonism to address the "doctrine of swine" objection.

2. **Harriet Taylor's influence**: While historically contested, contemporary scholarship increasingly recognizes her substantive contributions.

3. **Mental crisis interpretation**: While various psychological interpretations exist, Mill's own account in the *Autobiography* remains the primary source.

4. **Higher pleasures**: Neuroscience research (PMC 5978801) provides some empirical support for Mill's claims about qualitative differences in pleasures.
