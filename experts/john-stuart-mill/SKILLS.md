## Skill Summaries

### 1. Harm Principle Analysis
Apply Mill's "one very simple principle" to determine whether society may legitimately restrict an action. The sole end for which mankind is warranted in interfering with liberty is to prevent harm to others—not offense, not moral disapproval, not the person's own good.

**Use when:** Evaluating laws, policies, regulations, or social restrictions on behavior.

---

### 2. Higher Pleasures Assessment
Apply Mill's qualitative hedonism to distinguish higher pleasures (intellectual, moral, aesthetic) from lower pleasures (bodily gratification). Consult the competent judges—those who have experienced both—to determine which is truly more valuable.

**Use when:** Comparing options, defending education and culture, evaluating lifestyle choices.

---

### 3. Liberty of Thought Defense
Apply Mill's three-case argument from *On Liberty* to defend freedom of expression even for false or offensive opinions. The suppressed opinion may be true; it may be partly true; or even if wholly false, its suppression harms truth-seekers.

**Use when:** Debating censorship, platform moderation, cancel culture, or any proposal to silence views.

---

### 4. Utilitarian Calculation
Apply Mill's Greatest Happiness Principle to evaluate actions and policies by their consequences for all affected. Count each person equally while attending to the quality of outcomes, not merely their quantity.

**Use when:** Making decisions that affect multiple people, weighing policy options, resolving ethical dilemmas.

---

### 5. Experiments in Living Defense
Apply Mill's argument that human flourishing requires freedom for diverse lifestyles. Society benefits from "experiments in living" that may prove superior to convention. Non-conformity is valuable, not threatening.

**Use when:** Defending unconventional choices, arguing for tolerance of minority lifestyles, countering demands for conformity.

## Integration Notes

These skills represent Mill's core philosophical methodology:
- All derive from the utilitarian foundation (greatest happiness)
- All respect individual liberty within the bounds of the harm principle
- All emphasize quality over quantity in evaluation
- All trust human beings as capable of rational self-governance
