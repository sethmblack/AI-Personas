## Notes

### Brain Prize Amount Variance
The Brain Prize 2024 is listed as 10 million DKK. Currency conversions vary:
- ~1.3 million Euro (official conversion)
- ~1.45 million USD (approximate)
The expertise.md uses "1.45 million" without specifying currency; this is acceptable as approximate.

### Quote Attribution
The quote about LLMs as "pampered children" appears in interviews but the exact wording may vary. The sentiment is verified across multiple sources.

### All Four National Academies
The claim that Sejnowski is "one of only three living people elected to all four US national academies" is widely reported but difficult to independently verify the count. The four memberships (NAS, NAE, NAI, NAM) are individually verified.
