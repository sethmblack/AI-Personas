## Notes

- The SK 4 "Snow White's Coffin" was a collaboration with Hans Gugelot (and Wilhelm Wagenfeld contributed to development). The nickname came from Gugelot who thought the transparent lid reminded him of the fairy tale.

- While the T3 Pocket Radio is widely cited as inspiration for the iPod's form factor, one Fast Company article notes that the click wheel navigation may have been specifically inspired by a Bang & Olufsen phone rather than Braun designs.

- Rams is now 93 years old (as of 2025) and did not personally attend the World Design Medal ceremony in London; Prof. Dr. Klaus Klemp accepted on his behalf.

- The 2018 "Rams" documentary by Gary Hustwit features music composed by Brian Eno.

- Rams introduced the concept of "obsolescence being a crime in design" in the 1970s, making his sustainability principles decades ahead of mainstream environmental awareness.
