## HIGH Priority

### 1. ten-principles-audit

**Source Pattern:** Ten Principles of Good Design
**Purpose:** Systematically evaluate any design, product, process, or artifact against Dieter Rams' ten principles to identify specific improvements.
**Trigger:** "Audit this design" or "Apply the ten principles" or "Is this good design?"
**Inputs:** Description of design/product/process, context of use, target users
**Outputs:** Structured evaluation against all ten principles with specific scores, identified violations, and actionable recommendations

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | 10 explicit criteria with clear pass/fail assessment |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural trigger "audit this design," "apply Rams' principles" |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: systematic design evaluation |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to products, interfaces, processes, communications |
| Valuable | 10 | Provides comprehensive design quality framework |

**Total Score: 48 - HIGH**

---

### 2. reduction-protocol

**Source Pattern:** "Less, but better" / Principle #10
**Purpose:** Systematically identify and eliminate unnecessary elements from any artifact until nothing remains that could be removed without impairing function.
**Trigger:** "Simplify this" or "What can be removed?" or "Apply Rams' reduction"
**Inputs:** Description of artifact (design, document, process, interface), its core function
**Outputs:** Categorized list of elements (essential, questionable, removable), specific removal recommendations, simplified result

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear iterative process: identify, question, remove, test |
| Invocable | 10 | Natural triggers: "simplify," "reduce," "what can I cut" |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: systematic reduction |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to anything with elements: design, writing, process, code |
| Valuable | 10 | Addresses universal problem of accumulating complexity |

**Total Score: 49 - HIGH**

### 3. longevity-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Principle #7 (Long-lasting)
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether a design, decision, or approach will endure or is merely following current fashion.
**Trigger:** "Will this last?" or "Is this timeless or trendy?" or "Longevity check"
**Inputs:** Design/decision to evaluate, current trends it may be following, intended lifespan
**Outputs:** Assessment of fashionable vs. timeless elements, specific risks of obsolescence, recommendations for increasing longevity

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Clear criteria but requires judgment about trends |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers about lasting, aging, trends |
| Scoped | 9 | Single focus: temporal durability of design choices |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to product design, technology choices, branding, architecture |
| Valuable | 9 | Prevents costly redesigns and waste from fashion-following |

**Total Score: 44 - HIGH**

---

### 4. honesty-audit

**Source Pattern:** Principle #6 (Honest)
**Purpose:** Assess whether a design, product, or communication honestly represents its capabilities or manipulates through overpromise.
**Trigger:** "Is this honest?" or "Does this overpromise?" or "Honesty check"
**Inputs:** Design/product/communication to evaluate, claimed capabilities, actual capabilities
**Outputs:** Gap analysis between promise and reality, specific dishonest elements identified, recommendations for honest representation

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear comparison framework: promise vs. delivery |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers around honesty, manipulation, overpromise |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused but overlaps with marketing ethics generally |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to product design, marketing, UX, communications |
| Valuable | 9 | Prevents user disappointment and builds long-term trust |

**Total Score: 44 - HIGH**

---

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. environmental-impact-check

**Source Pattern:** Principle #9 (Environmentally Friendly)
**Purpose:** Evaluate the full lifecycle environmental impact of design decisions, from materials through disposal.
**Trigger:** "What's the environmental impact?" or "Sustainability check" or "Is this environmentally responsible?"
**Inputs:** Design/product specification, materials used, expected lifespan, disposal considerations
**Outputs:** Lifecycle impact assessment, specific environmental concerns, recommendations for reduced impact

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Framework exists but requires external data for full assessment |
| Invocable | 8 | Natural triggers around sustainability, environment |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused on environmental dimension of design |
| Reusable | 8 | Applies to product design, packaging, processes |
| Valuable | 8 | Increasingly critical concern, prevents greenwashing |

**Total Score: 39 - MEDIUM**

---

### 6. understandability-test

**Source Pattern:** Principle #4 (Understandable)
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether a design makes itself self-explanatory and clarifies its own structure and use.
**Trigger:** "Is this understandable?" or "Can users figure this out?" or "Self-explanatory test"
**Inputs:** Design/interface/product to evaluate, target user profile, context of use
**Outputs:** Assessment of self-explanatory qualities, identified confusion points, recommendations for clarity

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Clear evaluation criteria but requires user perspective |
| Invocable | 8 | Natural triggers around understanding, clarity, confusion |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused on comprehensibility |
| Reusable | 8 | Applies to any user-facing design or communication |
| Valuable | 7 | Valuable but overlaps with standard UX evaluation |

**Total Score: 39 - MEDIUM**

## LOW Priority

*None identified. Remaining patterns were either subsumed by the above or rejected.*

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Biographical information | Pure reference material, no workflow |
| Product examples (606, ET66, etc.) | Reference/inspiration, not actionable methodology |
| Famous quotes | Reference material for voice, not standalone workflow |
| Influence on Apple | Historical analysis, not actionable methodology |
| Career timeline | Pure reference information |
| Principle #1 (Innovative) | Too abstract for standalone skill; innovation requires domain expertise |
| Principle #2 (Useful) | Subsumed by function-first analysis in main audit |
| Principle #3 (Aesthetic) | Emerges from function; insufficient structure alone |
| Principle #5 (Unobtrusive) | Subsumed by reduction protocol |
| Principle #8 (Thorough) | Quality principle, not distinct methodology |
