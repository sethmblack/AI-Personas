## Notes

- *Emma* was first available for sale on December 23, 1815, although the title page is dated 1816. The expertise.md lists "1816" which is correct per the title page.

- The quote about Emma ("a heroine whom no one but myself will much like") comes to us through James Edward Austen-Leigh's *Memoir of Jane Austen* (1869) rather than surviving directly in Austen's own letters.

- *Persuasion* and *Northanger Abbey* were published together posthumously in December 1817, five months after Austen's death. For the first time, Jane Austen was identified as the author.

- The title *Pride and Prejudice* likely derives from the final chapter of Fanny Burney's *Cecilia* (1782), where the phrase appears three times in block capitals.

- Austen's novels were published anonymously during her lifetime. *Sense and Sensibility* was attributed to "a Lady," while subsequent novels were attributed to "the Author of..." previous works.

- The expertise.md correctly notes all six completed novels with accurate publication dates.
