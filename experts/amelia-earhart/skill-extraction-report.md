## HIGH Priority

### 1. paper-tiger-fear-reframe

**Source Pattern:** Philosophy of Courage / Fear as Paper Tigers
**Purpose:** Transform paralyzing fears into manageable concerns by revealing them as less substantial than they appear, enabling decisive action.
**Trigger:** "I'm afraid to..." or "This fear is stopping me" or "Help me deal with my fear of..."
**Inputs:** Description of the fear, what action is being prevented, how long the paralysis has lasted
**Outputs:** Reframed perspective on the fear, decision-making framework, action plan with commitment point
**Reasoning:** This is Earhart's signature psychological technique—the recognition that fear inflates itself and shrinks when confronted. Highly actionable with clear steps: identify fear, assess reality, reframe as paper tiger, commit to action. Universally applicable to career decisions, creative risks, personal challenges.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear reframing process with decision point
- Invocable: YES - Natural trigger phrases when facing fear
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility (fear reframing for action)
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any fear-blocked situation
- Valuable: YES - Unlocks paralyzed people to take action

### 2. calculated-risk-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Risk Assessment Framework / Risk-Reward Calibration
**Purpose:** Systematically evaluate whether a goal justifies its risks, then commit fully or walk away—eliminating the wasteful middle ground of worry.
**Trigger:** "Should I take this risk?" or "Is this worth it?" or "Help me decide about this risky opportunity"
**Inputs:** Description of the opportunity/goal, perceived risks, potential rewards, current preparation level
**Outputs:** Risk-reward assessment, preparation gap analysis, clear recommendation (commit or decline), worry-elimination if committing
**Reasoning:** Earhart's framework distinguishes between assessment and worry. Assessment is useful; worry after commitment is destructive. This creates a clear decision point and post-decision protocol. Widely applicable to career moves, investments, relationships, creative projects.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear assessment steps and decision framework
- Invocable: YES - Common trigger situations around risk decisions
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility (risk evaluation and commitment)
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any significant risk decision
- Valuable: YES - Eliminates paralysis and wasteful worry

**Score: 44/50**

### 3. barrier-breaking-protocol

**Source Pattern:** Breaking Barriers Method / Challenge-to-Others Frame
**Purpose:** Approach impossible-seeming goals as both personal achievements and contributions to collective progress, transforming even failure into meaningful impact.
**Trigger:** "I want to be the first to..." or "No one like me has done this" or "This seems impossible but..."
**Inputs:** The barrier/goal, who has done it before (if anyone), what attempting it would demonstrate, who might be encouraged by the attempt
**Outputs:** Barrier reality assessment, preparation plan, framing of attempt within larger movement, failure-as-challenge perspective
**Reasoning:** Earhart's most distinctive contribution—connecting individual achievement to collective progress. Particularly valuable for underrepresented groups attempting firsts, but applicable to any unprecedented personal goal. Creates meaning even in failure.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear steps for approaching unprecedented goals
- Invocable: YES - Triggered by "first" or "impossible" language
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility (barrier approach strategy)
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any unprecedented personal goal
- Valuable: YES - Creates framework for meaningful risk-taking

**Score: 43/50**

### 4. runway-audit

**Source Pattern:** Runway Construction / The Runway Assessment
**Purpose:** Assess existing advantages and gaps, then either leverage advantages fully or build what's missing—for yourself and those who follow.
**Trigger:** "I don't have the advantages others have" or "How do I start from nothing?" or "What resources do I need?"
**Inputs:** Description of goal, perceived advantages and disadvantages, comparison to others who have succeeded
**Outputs:** Inventory of existing "runways," gap analysis, construction plan for missing resources, legacy consideration (building for others)
**Reasoning:** Earhart's runway metaphor transforms complaints about unfairness into action plans. Clear diagnostic: do you have a runway? If yes, use it. If no, build it. Adds unique dimension of building for those who follow. Applicable to career development, entrepreneurship, skill-building.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear diagnostic and construction framework
- Invocable: YES - Triggered by disadvantage/starting-from-scratch language
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility (resource assessment and development)
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any starting-from-behind situation
- Valuable: YES - Transforms victimhood into agency

**Score: 42/50**

### 5. preparation-audit

**Source Pattern:** The Two-Thirds Principle / Preparation Philosophy
**Purpose:** Assess readiness for a venture against Earhart's two-thirds standard, identifying preparation gaps before commitment.
**Trigger:** "Am I ready for this?" or "Have I prepared enough?" or "What else should I do before starting?"
**Inputs:** Description of the venture, current preparation completed, timeline, stakes involved
**Outputs:** Preparation score against two-thirds standard, gap identification, prioritized preparation plan, readiness recommendation
**Reasoning:** Earhart's practical counterweight to courage—courage without preparation is recklessness. The two-thirds ratio provides a concrete benchmark. Applicable before major career moves, product launches, difficult conversations, or any high-stakes venture.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear ratio and gap analysis process
- Invocable: YES - Triggered by readiness questions
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility (preparation assessment)
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any significant venture
- Valuable: YES - Prevents under-preparation while avoiding paralysis

**Score: 41/50**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 6. adventure-as-education

**Trigger:** "Is this experience worth it?" or "Should I take this unconventional path?" or "How do I build real-world skills?"
**Inputs:** Description of unconventional opportunity, traditional alternative, skills/adaptability sought
**Outputs:** Comparison of educational value, identification of adaptability gains, plan for maximizing learning from adventure
**Reasoning:** Earhart's insight that adventure builds something formal education cannot—adaptability to the unexpected. Useful for gap year decisions, unconventional career paths, travel vs. credential debates. Less structured than high-priority skills.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: PARTIAL - Provides framework but outcomes less predictable
- Invocable: YES - Triggered by unconventional path questions
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility (adventure value assessment)
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any traditional vs. unconventional choice

**Score: 36/50**

### 7. demonstration-over-debate

**Source Pattern:** Demonstration Over Debate / The Feminist Paradox
**Purpose:** Identify when proving through action is more effective than arguing through words, and design demonstration strategies.
**Trigger:** "How do I convince them I can do this?" or "They don't believe in me" or "How do I prove my capability?"
**Inputs:** What capability is doubted, who doubts it, what demonstration would be undeniable, resources available for demonstration
**Outputs:** Assessment of debate vs. demonstration effectiveness, demonstration strategy, success criteria that eliminate doubt
**Reasoning:** Earhart's strategic approach—she proved women could fly by flying, not by arguing. Useful when facing skeptics, breaking into new fields, or overcoming bias. Less structured as a skill but valuable principle.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: PARTIAL - Principle is clear but application varies widely
- Invocable: YES - Triggered by doubt/skepticism situations
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility (strategy selection)
