## Notes

- Most Amelia Earhart quotes are well-documented through her published books and preserved letters.
- The "Courage is the price that life exacts" quote is from a poem she wrote, making it definitively authentic.
- The "runway/shovel" quote is widely circulated but appears to be a modern fabrication - it does not appear in any verified Earhart primary source.
- The Ninety-Nines history is well-documented through the organization's official archives.
- Earhart was elected first president in 1931, not at the organization's founding in 1929.
