## Philosophy on Women's Equality

### Equal Capability, Equal Opportunity
Earhart believed women should have identical opportunities to prove themselves, without favor or handicap based on sex.

**Key insight:** "Now and then women should do for themselves what men have already done—occasionally what men have not done—thereby establishing themselves as persons, and perhaps encouraging other women toward greater independence of thought and action."

### Demonstration Over Debate
Earhart believed in proving capability through action rather than arguing for it. Her solo Atlantic flight was specifically undertaken to prove she was more than a passenger.

### Institutional Advocacy
Beyond personal achievement, she worked to change systems:
- Lobbied President Hoover for the Equal Rights Amendment (1932)
- Co-founded and served as first president of the Ninety-Nines (organization for women pilots)
- Spoke at universities encouraging women to pursue unconventional paths
- Served as career counselor at Purdue University

### On Education and Gender
She challenged the tracking of students by gender rather than aptitude.

**Key insight:** "The educational system was based on 'sex, not aptitude'... I know a great many boys who should be making pies—and a great many girls who would be better off in manual training."

## The Ninety-Nines

### Founding (1929)
After the first Women's Air Derby, Earhart was among six pilots who conceived an organization for female aviators. On November 2, 1929, twenty-six licensed women pilots founded the organization.

### The Name
When members proposed names like "The Climbing Vines" or "Noisy Birdwomen," Earhart suggested taking the name from membership count. As 99 charter members joined, they became the Ninety-Nines.

### Purpose
- Mutual support and networking for women pilots
- Advancement of women in aviation
- Central repository for files on women in aviation

### Legacy
The Ninety-Nines continues today with 153 chapters across 27 regional sections globally, offering scholarships through the Amelia Earhart Memorial Scholarship Fund.

## Famous Quotations

### On Courage and Action
> "Courage is the price that life exacts for granting peace."

> "The most difficult thing is the decision to act. The rest is merely tenacity."

> "The most effective way to do it, is to do it."

> "Worry retards reaction and makes clear-cut decisions impossible."

### On Adventure and Risk
> "Adventure is worthwhile in itself."

> "Everyone has oceans to fly, if they have the heart to do it."

> "No borders, just horizons—only freedom."

> "Decide whether or not the goal is worth the risks involved. If it is, stop worrying."

### On Women and Achievement
> "Women, like men, should try to do the impossible. And when they fail, their failure should be a challenge to others."

> "The more women fly, the more who become pilots, the quicker will we be recognized as an important factor in aviation."

### On Preparation and Self-Reliance
> "Preparation, I have often said, is rightly two-thirds of any venture."

### On Kindness and Impact
> "No kind action ever stops with itself. One kind action leads to another... A single act of kindness throws out roots in all directions, and the roots spring up and make new trees."
