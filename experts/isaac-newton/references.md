## Secondary Sources - Specific Topics

### The Apple Story

**Claim:** William Stukeley recorded Newton's account of the apple on April 15, 1726

**Source:** Stukeley, W. (1752). *Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's Life*. Royal Society MS/142.

**URL:** https://royalsociety.org/news/2010/newton-apple-story/

**Verification:** Royal Society confirms the manuscript and date. The story describes observation, not impact on head.

### Halley and Principia Publication

**Claim:** Halley financed Principia publication personally after Royal Society spent budget on Historia Piscium

**Source:**
- Cook, A. (1998). *Edmond Halley: Charting the Heavens and the Seas*. Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0198500315
- Royal Society Council minutes, June 2, 1686

**Verification:** Halley paid printing costs. Royal Society paid his 1686 salary in unsold copies of Historia Piscium.

### Speed of Sound Calculation

**Claim:** Newton calculated 979 ft/sec; Laplace corrected in 1816 with adiabatic formula

**Source:**
- Newton, I. Principia, Book II, Proposition 49
- Laplace, P.S. (1816). "Sur la vitesse du son dans l'air et dans l'eau." *Annales de Chimie et de Physique*, 3, 238-241.

**Verification:** Newton's isothermal assumption and Laplace's adiabatic correction are standard physics history.

### William Chaloner

**Claim:** Newton prosecuted counterfeiter William Chaloner; Chaloner hanged March 22, 1699

**Source:**
- Levenson, T. (2009). *Newton and the Counterfeiter*. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. ISBN 978-0151012787
- Old Bailey Proceedings, March 3, 1699

**URL:** https://www.oldbaileyonline.org/

### Keynes on Newton's Alchemy

**Claim:** Keynes called Newton "the last of the magicians"

**Source:** Keynes, J.M. (1947). "Newton, the Man." Royal Society Newton Tercentenary Celebrations. Cambridge University Press.

**Verification:** Keynes acquired Newton's alchemical papers at auction in 1936 and presented this assessment posthumously (Keynes died 1946; paper read 1947).

### Hooke-Newton Correspondence

**Claim:** Hooke wrote to Newton in 1679 about planetary attraction

**Source:** The Correspondence of Isaac Newton, Vol. 2 (1676-1687). Turnbull, H.W. (ed.). Cambridge University Press, 1960.

**Letter:** Hooke to Newton, November 24, 1679

## Notes on Contested Items

### "Shoulders of Giants" Interpretation

Some historians interpret Newton's phrase to Hooke as sarcastic (Hooke was short and hunchbacked), rather than humble acknowledgment. The expertise.md uses the conventional interpretation as genuine humility. Both interpretations exist in scholarship.

**Sources for sarcasm interpretation:**
- Merton, R.K. (1965). *On the Shoulders of Giants*. Free Press.

### Newton's Mental Health (1690s)

The expertise.md mentions "periods of mental instability in 1690s" attributed to possible mercury poisoning. This is contested:

- **Mercury hypothesis:** Supported by analysis of Newton's hair samples showing elevated mercury levels (Johnson & Wolbarsht, 1979)
- **Alternative explanations:** Overwork, personal conflicts, natural causes

**Expertise.md wording:** Uses "possible" - appropriately hedged.
