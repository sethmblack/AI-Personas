## HIGH Priority

### 1. simplicity-audit

**Source Pattern:** Simplicity as the Ultimate Sophistication / Focus Through Saying No
**Purpose:** Systematically eliminate unnecessary complexity from a product, feature, or process by applying Jobs's ruthless simplification methodology.
**Trigger:** "Review this product for complexity" or "Simplify this feature" or "There are too many options"
**Inputs:** Product/feature description, current feature list, user workflows, complexity complaints
**Outputs:** Complexity diagnosis, elimination recommendations (what to cut), simplification roadmap, three-click test results
**Reasoning:** Jobs's simplification methodology is highly actionable with clear criteria (three-click rule, remove until essential, hide complexity). Applies to any product, feature, or process. Prevents the common error of adding features to solve problems.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear steps: identify essence, apply three-click test, eliminate non-essentials
- Invocable: YES - Natural triggers around complexity and feature bloat
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility: simplification
- Reusable: YES - Products, features, processes, documentation, interfaces
- Valuable: YES - Prevents feature creep, improves user experience

**Score: 48/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

### 2. product-vision-frame

**Source Pattern:** Customers Don't Know What They Want / Start with Customer Experience / Focus Through Elimination
**Purpose:** Define a product's singular purpose and ruthlessly align all decisions to that vision, rejecting good ideas that don't serve the core.
**Trigger:** "What should we build?" or "How do we prioritize our roadmap?" or "We're trying to do too many things"
**Inputs:** Product concept, target users, current feature ideas, market context
**Outputs:** Product essence statement, elimination list (good ideas to reject), focus criteria, vision narrative
**Reasoning:** Jobs's product vision methodology combines customer experience focus with ruthless prioritization. Highly actionable framework for product teams struggling with direction.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear framework: define essence, work backward from experience, eliminate non-essentials
- Invocable: YES - Product strategy questions trigger naturally
- Scoped: YES - Product direction, not implementation
- Reusable: YES - Any product, feature, or initiative
- Valuable: YES - Prevents "we do everything" trap

**Score: 47/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

### 3. a-player-hiring

**Source Pattern:** A Players Hire A Players / Jobs's Hiring Approach
**Purpose:** Evaluate candidates and hiring decisions through the A-player framework to prevent organizational talent decay.
**Trigger:** "Should we hire this person?" or "How do we build a great team?" or "Our team quality is declining"
**Inputs:** Candidate profile, role requirements, existing team composition, hiring criteria
**Outputs:** A-player assessment, bozo explosion risk analysis, hiring recommendation, team quality trajectory
**Reasoning:** Jobs's hiring framework is distinctive and actionable. The A/B/C player model provides clear evaluation criteria. Addresses a universal challenge in scaling organizations.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear criteria for A-player identification, bozo explosion detection
- Invocable: YES - Hiring decisions trigger naturally
- Scoped: YES - Talent evaluation and team building
- Reusable: YES - Any organization, any role
- Valuable: YES - Prevents irreversible organizational decay

**Score: 46/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

### 4. keynote-storytelling

**Source Pattern:** Keynote Presentation Techniques / Problem-Solution Framing / Rule of Three
**Purpose:** Structure product announcements and presentations using Jobs's proven storytelling and presentation methodology.
**Trigger:** "Help me with this presentation" or "How do I announce this product?" or "I need to communicate this vision"
**Inputs:** Product/announcement to present, key messages, audience context, available demos
**Outputs:** Structured presentation outline, problem-solution narrative, memorable phrases, "one more thing" candidates
**Reasoning:** Jobs's presentation methodology is highly documented and reproducible. Rule of three, problem-solution framing, and simplicity in slides are actionable techniques with proven impact.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear techniques: rule of three, problem-solution, slide simplicity
- Invocable: YES - Presentation and announcement requests
- Scoped: YES - External communication and launches
- Reusable: YES - Product launches, investor pitches, company announcements
- Valuable: YES - Transforms forgettable presentations into memorable events

**Score: 45/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. reality-distortion-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Reality Distortion Field
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether a situation warrants applying conviction and persistence to achieve the "impossible," or whether constraints are genuinely immovable.
**Trigger:** "This is impossible" or "We can't do this" or "It can't be done in that timeframe"
**Inputs:** Stated constraint, desired outcome, team capabilities, past "impossible" achievements
**Outputs:** Constraint classification (real vs. perceived), distortion potential, recommended approach, risk assessment
**Reasoning:** The reality distortion field concept is powerful but requires judgment in application. This skill helps distinguish when to push through perceived limits vs. when limits are real.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: MODERATE - Requires judgment about constraint validity
- Invocable: YES - "Impossible" claims trigger naturally
- Scoped: YES - Constraint evaluation
- Reusable: YES - Any situation with stated limitations
- Valuable: MODERATE - Can enable breakthroughs but risks burnout if misapplied

**Score: 40/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

---

### 6. integrated-design-review

**Source Pattern:** Design Is How It Works / Integrated Systems
**Purpose:** Review products and systems through Jobs's lens of integrated design where hardware, software, and user experience are inseparable.
**Trigger:** "Review this product design" or "Should we integrate or modularize?" or "Design and engineering are not aligned"
**Inputs:** Product architecture, team structure, user experience flows, system boundaries
**Outputs:** Integration assessment, design-engineering alignment report, user experience continuity analysis
**Reasoning:** Jobs's integrated design philosophy provides a specific lens for architectural decisions. Useful but more specialized than other skills.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: MODERATE - Philosophy is clear but application requires context
- Invocable: YES - Design review and architecture questions
- Scoped: YES - Product architecture and design integration
- Reusable: MODERATE - Primarily hardware/software products
- Valuable: MODERATE - Important for certain product types

**Score: 38/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**
