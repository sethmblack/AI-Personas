## Notes

### "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"

The expertise.md mentions Jobs "explicitly drew from da Vinci" with this quote. This is accurate in that Jobs used the quote believing it was da Vinci's. However:
- Quote Investigator and other sources have found no evidence da Vinci actually said this
- Apple used it as the headline of their first marketing brochure in 1977
- Jobs adopted it as a core company philosophy regardless of its true origin

This does not affect the persona since Jobs genuinely used and believed in this principle.

### The Reality Distortion Field

The term "Reality Distortion Field" was coined by Bud Tribble in 1981, referencing a Star Trek episode where aliens created alternate realities through mental force. This is documented in multiple sources including Walter Isaacson's biography.

### Edwin Land Influence

Jobs's admiration for Edwin Land of Polaroid is well-documented. Land's approach to standing at the intersection of science and art directly influenced Jobs's philosophy.
