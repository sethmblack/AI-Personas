## Extraction Methodology

Each potential skill evaluated against five criteria:
- **Actionable** - Clear, repeatable steps
- **Invocable** - Could be triggered by request
- **Scoped** - One responsibility, clear boundaries
- **Reusable** - Applies across contexts
- **Valuable** - Saves significant effort

## Skill Candidates Identified

### 1. Friction Analysis

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear framework: identify friction sources, assess cumulative impact |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Clear trigger: "Why isn't this working?" "Plans keep failing" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | One responsibility: diagnosing execution gaps |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Any situation where plans fail in execution |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Prevents repeated failure from ignoring friction |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Analyze why plans fail in execution by identifying sources of friction—the countless minor difficulties that accumulate to create a gap between theory and reality. Distinguish between friction that can be reduced and friction that must be absorbed.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Why isn't this working as planned?"
- "The plan was good but execution failed"
- "Everything keeps going wrong"
- "We're experiencing constant delays"

### 2. Center of Gravity Identification

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear steps: analyze power sources, identify hub, focus effort |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Clear trigger: "What should we focus on?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on identifying decisive points |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Any competitive or strategic situation |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Prevents wasted effort on non-decisive actions |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Identify the hub of power and movement upon which everything depends—for yourself and your opponent. Concentrate effort at this decisive point rather than dispersing across targets.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What should we focus on?"
- "We're spread too thin"
- "What's the key to winning this?"
- "Where should we concentrate resources?"

### 3. Fog of War Decision Framework

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Framework for deciding under uncertainty |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Clear trigger: "I don't have enough information" |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on decision-making under uncertainty |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Any decision with incomplete information |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Essential for leadership in complex situations |

**Total: 48/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Make sound decisions when information is incomplete, contradictory, or uncertain. Distinguish what is known, inferred, and assumed. Build judgment that functions when certainty is impossible.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "I don't have enough information to decide"
- "The data is contradictory"
- "Should I wait for more information?"
- "How do I decide under uncertainty?"

---

### 4. Culminating Point Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Clear diagnostic framework for overextension |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Clear trigger: "Are we overextending?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on recognizing limits of advance |
| Reusable | 9/10 | Any offensive or expansion situation |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Prevents catastrophic overextension |

**Total: 48/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Assess whether an offensive, expansion, or initiative is approaching its culminating point—the moment when continuing forward makes you weaker than stopping. Determine whether to press on or consolidate.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Are we overextending?"
- "Should we keep pushing?"
- "We've had great success—what now?"
- "How far should we go?"

### 5. Trinity Analysis

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Three-factor framework for comprehensive analysis |
| Invocable | 9/10 | "What are we missing?" "Is our analysis complete?" |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on comprehensive situation assessment |
| Reusable | 9/10 | Strategic decisions involving multiple stakeholders |
| Valuable | 9/10 | Prevents one-dimensional analysis |

**Total: 45/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Analyze any strategic situation through the three elements of Clausewitz's trinity: passion/emotion (the people), chance/creativity (execution), and rational purpose (leadership). Ensure strategy accounts for all three.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What are we missing in this analysis?"
- "Is this strategy complete?"
- "Why isn't this working politically?"
- "We have a logical plan but no support"

---

### 6. Defense vs. Attack Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Framework requires situational judgment |
| Invocable | 9/10 | "Should we attack or defend?" |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on attack/defense posture |
| Reusable | 8/10 | Competitive and conflict situations |
| Valuable | 9/10 | Prevents attacking when defense is wiser |

**Total: 43/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** Determine whether the strategic situation calls for offensive or defensive posture. Understand that defense is stronger but has only a negative aim, while attack is weaker but alone achieves positive objectives.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Should we attack or defend?"
- "Should we be proactive or reactive?"
- "We're under pressure—what's our posture?"
- "Is this a time to advance or hold?"

---

### 7. Political Purpose Alignment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Clear diagnostic for purpose-action alignment |
| Invocable | 8/10 | "Why are we doing this?" |
| Scoped | 8/10 | Focused on strategy-purpose coherence |
| Reusable | 8/10 | Any strategic initiative |
| Valuable | 9/10 | Prevents means-ends disconnection |

**Total: 41/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** Ensure that all actions serve and remain connected to the ultimate political/strategic purpose. Diagnose when tactical success has become disconnected from strategic objectives.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Why are we doing this again?"
- "We're winning battles but losing the war"
- "What's the point of this effort?"
- "How does this serve our goal?"

## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority):**
1. `friction-analysis` - Diagnose why plans fail in execution
2. `center-of-gravity-identification` - Find the decisive point
3. `fog-of-war-decision` - Decide under uncertainty
4. `culminating-point-assessment` - Recognize limits of advance

**Phase 2 - Extended Skills:**
5. `trinity-analysis` - Comprehensive strategic assessment

**Future Consideration:**
- Defense vs. Attack Assessment (more specialized)
- Political Purpose Alignment (overlaps with trinity analysis)

---

## Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Listed in `experts/carl-von-clausewitz/PROMPT.md` in the "Assigned Skills" section (already present)
2. Triggered proactively when the Clausewitz expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly

---

## Skill Interaction Notes

**Complementary Relationships:**
- Friction Analysis + Culminating Point: Both address why offensives stall
- Center of Gravity + Trinity Analysis: Both focus strategic thinking
- Fog of War + Friction: Both address uncertainty and execution gaps

**Synergies with Other Experts:**
- Sun Tzu's terrain analysis complements Clausewitz's center of gravity
- Alexander's speed/audacity contrasts with Clausewitz's friction warnings
- Machiavelli's political analysis complements war-as-politics framework
