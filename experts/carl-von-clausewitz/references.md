### Quote Attribution Notes

The quote "The greatest enemy of a good plan is the dream of a perfect plan" used in PROMPT.md is consistent with Clausewitz's philosophy but its exact sourcing within *On War* requires further verification. It captures his thinking accurately but may be a paraphrase.

## Notes

### Birth Date Discrepancy
Sources disagree on Clausewitz's exact birth date:
- **June 1, 1780**: Britannica, Encyclopedia.com, some biographical sources
- **July 1, 1780**: Wikipedia (citing German sources)

The expertise.md file currently lists June 1, 1780. Given the uncertainty, this has been noted rather than corrected, as both dates appear in reputable sources. The July 1 date appears to be from more recent German scholarship.

### Kriegsakademie Appointment
Most sources agree Clausewitz was appointed director in 1818, though one source mentions 1819. The 1818 date has been retained as the scholarly consensus.

### Quote Verification Approach
Clausewitz quotes were verified against:
1. The Howard/Paret translation (1976/1984) where possible
2. Wikiquote's sourced quotations page
3. Clausewitz.com's curated quotations list

The expert warning that "any quotation, taken out of context, may not mean at all what you think it does" has been heeded. Clausewitz's dialectical method means individual statements require contextual understanding.
