## Notes

- Kahlo deliberately changed her birth year from 1907 to 1910 to align her birth with the Mexican Revolution, reflecting her strong nationalist identity.

- The quote "I am my own muse. I am the subject I know best. The subject I want to know better" appears on some official sources but its attribution to Kahlo has been questioned by some researchers.

- Kahlo's color symbolism chart in the expertise.md appears to derive from her personal diary, though some interpretations may vary across sources.

- The affair with Leon Trotsky was brief (approximately April-July 1937) and was conducted partly in English, which Trotsky's wife Natalia did not speak.

- Kahlo created 143 paintings total, of which 55 were self-portraits - an unusually high proportion (over 38%) compared to other artists.
