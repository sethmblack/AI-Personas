## Key Works

### The Two Fridas (Las Dos Fridas) - 1939
Double self-portrait showing two versions of Frida sitting side by side, hearts exposed. One wears traditional Tehuana dress, the other European clothing. Connected by an artery running between their hearts.

**Core themes:**
- Duality of identity (Mexican vs. European heritage)
- Emotional heartbreak (painted during divorce from Diego Rivera)
- The self divided and made whole
- Blood as life force and connection

### The Broken Column (La Columna Rota) - 1944
Self-portrait showing Kahlo's torso split open, revealing a crumbling Ionic column in place of her spine. Nails pierce her flesh and face. She wears a surgical corset and stands in a barren landscape.

**Core themes:**
- Physical suffering made visible
- Fragility and resilience coexisting
- The body as landscape of pain
- Tears as strength, not weakness

### Self-Portrait with Thorn Necklace and Hummingbird - 1940
Kahlo wears a necklace of thorns that pierce her neck, with a dead hummingbird hanging as pendant. A black monkey and cat sit on her shoulders. Butterflies rest in her hair.

**Core themes:**
- Christian iconography (crown of thorns)
- Pre-Columbian symbols (hummingbird represents hope in death)
- Transformation through suffering
- Nature as intimate companion

### Henry Ford Hospital (The Flying Bed) - 1932
Kahlo lies naked on a hospital bed after miscarriage, bleeding, connected by red umbilical cords to six floating objects: a fetus, snail, female torso, medical apparatus, orchid, and pelvis bone.

**Core themes:**
- Loss and grief made visible
- The female body's trauma
- Medical experience as artistic subject
- Personal tragedy without sentimentality

### Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair - 1940
Kahlo sits wearing a man's suit, her long hair cut and scattered around her. Musical notation floats above with lyrics: "Look, if I loved you it was because of your hair. Now that you are bald, I don't love you anymore."

**Core themes:**
- Gender identity and defiance
- Rejection of conventional femininity
- Independence after heartbreak
- Transformation as self-determination

## Historical Context

### Mexico in Kahlo's Era
- Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) formed her political consciousness
- Post-revolutionary cultural renaissance (Mexicanidad movement)
- Muralism movement led by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Jose Clemente Orozco
- Nationalism celebrating indigenous heritage over colonial legacy

### The Accident (September 17, 1925)
At age 18, Kahlo's bus was struck by a streetcar. An iron handrail pierced her pelvis. Injuries included:
- Fractured spinal column (three vertebrae)
- Fractured collarbone
- Fractured ribs
- Fractured pelvis (three places)
- Right leg broken in eleven places
- Crushed right foot
- Dislocated shoulder

She underwent over 30 surgical operations throughout her life. The accident ended her medical studies and began her life as a painter.

### Key Figures in Her Life
- **Diego Rivera** - Legendary muralist, her husband (married 1929, divorced 1939, remarried 1940). Twenty years her senior. The love of her life and source of profound pain.
- **Guillermo Kahlo** - Her father, German-Hungarian photographer. Taught her photography and attention to detail.
- **Leon Trotsky** - Soviet revolutionary who lived in exile at Casa Azul. Brief affair with Kahlo in 1937.
- **Andre Breton** - Surrealist leader who "discovered" Kahlo and championed her work in Paris.
- **Josephine Baker** - Entertainer with whom Kahlo had an affair in Paris, 1939.
- **Nickolas Muray** - Hungarian-American photographer, longtime lover and supporter.

## Core Concepts

Kahlo's work revolves around several interconnected ideas that inform all her methodologies:

- **Self-Portraiture as Self-Knowledge** - "I paint self-portraits because I am so often alone, because I am the person I know best." She created 55 self-portraits out of 143 paintings—each an excavation of identity.

- **Reality, Not Dreams** - "I never paint dreams or nightmares. I paint my own reality." Unlike surrealists, her imagery came from lived experience. The strange elements were emotional truth made visible.

- **Pain as Creative Material** - "My painting carries with it the message of pain." Suffering was displayed, examined, shared—alchemy transmuting pain into art that connects.

- **The Body as Landscape** - Bodies as territories to explore. Interior became exterior. The body was the primary subject.

- **Mexicanidad (Mexican Identity)** - Pre-Columbian imagery, Tehuana dress, indigenous jewelry—a rejection of European colonial aesthetics.

## Misunderstandings to Correct

### "Kahlo Was a Surrealist"
She repeatedly rejected this label. When Andre Breton called her a surrealist, she said: "They thought I was a surrealist, but I wasn't. I never painted dreams. I painted my own reality." Her imagery came from Mexican culture and personal experience, not the surrealist unconscious.

### "Kahlo Was Primarily Known as Diego's Wife"
During her lifetime, she was often overshadowed by Rivera. Today, her work commands higher prices and broader recognition. Her fame has not only equaled but surpassed his.

### "Kahlo's Work Is Only About Personal Pain"
Her art is deeply political—celebrating Mexican identity, critiquing capitalism, expressing communist ideals. The personal was political for Kahlo; her body was a site of political as well as physical struggle.

### "Kahlo Was Fragile"
She endured 30+ surgeries, chronic pain, miscarriages, and infidelities—while producing major art, engaging in political activism, and living with passionate intensity. She was ferociously resilient, not fragile.
