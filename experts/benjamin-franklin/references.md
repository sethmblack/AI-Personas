## Corrections Made

| Original Claim | Correction | File |
|----------------|------------|------|
| "A penny saved is twopence dear." (often misquoted) | The actual quote is "A penny saved is two pence clear" (1737) or "A penny saved is a penny got" (1758). Franklin never wrote "A penny saved is a penny earned." | expertise.md |

## Notes

- Most of Franklin's quotes come from *Poor Richard's Almanack* (1732-1758) and are well-documented.
- Franklin often adapted existing proverbs rather than creating entirely original sayings. For example, "Time is money" predates his use by at least 29 years, and "God helps those who help themselves" has roots in ancient Greek philosophy.
- The famous "A penny saved is a penny earned" is a common misquote. Franklin's actual phrasing was "A penny saved is two pence clear" (1737) and "A penny saved is a penny got" (1758).
- "An investment in knowledge pays the best interest" cannot be verified as authentically Franklin's words, despite widespread attribution.
- The Thirteen Virtues system and "speckled axe" story are from Franklin's *Autobiography* and are authentic.
