## HIGH Priority

### 1. virtue-practice

**Source Pattern:** The Thirteen Virtues System
**Purpose:** Guide users through systematic personal improvement using Franklin's proven method of tracking virtues, focusing on one at a time, and cycling through them consistently.
**Trigger:** "Help me develop better habits," "I want to work on my character," "How do I stop doing X," "Create a virtue tracking system for me"
**Inputs:** Target behaviors or virtues to develop; current challenges or faults to address; time commitment (default: 13-week cycle)
**Outputs:** Personalized virtue list with precepts; tracking system design; weekly focus schedule; reflection prompts; "speckled axe" perspective on imperfection
**Reasoning:** Core Franklin methodology with clear 5-step process used throughout his life. High reuse across personal development contexts. Saves users from reinventing habit-tracking approaches. Estimated 2+ uses/week for personal coaching scenarios.

---

### 2. diplomatic-persuasion

**Source Pattern:** Diplomatic Indirection
**Purpose:** Help users navigate politically sensitive situations through measured language, strategic questioning, and persuasion without confrontation.
**Trigger:** "How do I persuade my boss without creating conflict," "Navigate this political situation," "I need to influence someone who disagrees with me," "Help me handle this negotiation"
**Inputs:** Current situation and relationship dynamics; desired outcome; constraints and sensitivities; cultural context if relevant
**Outputs:** Recommended approach (direct vs. indirect); specific language alternatives (measured phrases replacing definitive assertions); question strategy to lead others to conclusions; potential humor or deflection techniques
**Reasoning:** Franklin's most distinctive diplomatic contribution, proven at the highest levels (French court, Treaty of Paris). High value for leadership, management, and organizational politics. Estimated 2+ uses/week.

---

## MEDIUM Priority

### 3. junto-circle

**Source Pattern:** The Junto Method
**Purpose:** Design and facilitate mutual improvement groups using Franklin's structured inquiry approach, including standing questions and multiplication principles.
**Trigger:** "Help me start a mastermind group," "Design a peer learning circle," "How should I structure networking meetings," "Create discussion questions for our group"
**Inputs:** Group purpose and size; member characteristics; meeting frequency; specific topics or domains of focus
**Outputs:** Standing questions customized to purpose; meeting structure and rules; member selection criteria; multiplication strategy (how each member can start their own group)
**Reasoning:** Proven model that spawned major institutions. Less frequently invoked than virtue-practice or diplomatic-persuasion, but high value when needed. Estimated 1-2 uses/week.

---

### 4. practical-experiment

**Source Pattern:** Practical Experiment Method
**Purpose:** Break analysis paralysis by guiding users through rapid prototyping and empirical testing of ideas rather than endless theorizing.
**Trigger:** "Should I build this or keep planning?," "We've been debating this forever," "How do I know if this idea works?," "Help me test this hypothesis"
**Inputs:** The idea or hypothesis to test; available resources and constraints; acceptable failure modes; timeline
**Outputs:** Minimum viable experiment design; success/failure criteria; observation framework; iteration plan based on results
**Reasoning:** Core to Franklin's inventive success (lightning rod, stove, etc.). Addresses common problem of overthinking. Estimated 1-2 uses/week.

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Poor Richard's Maxims | Reference knowledge without procedural workflow; too broad in scope covering disparate topics; stays as expertise material |
| Writing Style Development | Lower distinctiveness for Franklin persona; writing improvement covered by existing skills; method less structured than other candidates |
| Key Life Events | Pure reference/biographical data, no workflow |
| Inventions List | Reference material; the *method* is captured in practical-experiment skill |
