## Skills Identified

### 1. franchise-system-design

| Criterion | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Actionable | 5/5 | Creates a comprehensive blueprint for systematizing and replicating any process or platform |
| Invocable | 5/5 | Clear trigger: "scale this," "replicate," "franchise model," "standardize for others" |
| Scoped | 5/5 | Defined process: document, make teachable, enforce standards, enable operators, improve centrally |
| Reusable | 5/5 | Applies to platform engineering, internal tools, runbooks, operational procedures, service offerings |
| Valuable | 5/5 | Transforms one-off solutions into scalable, replicable systems |

**Total: 25/25 - EXTRACTED**

**Source Framework:** The Franchise Formula
- Create the playbook - Document exactly how to succeed
- Make it teachable - Anyone should be able to learn it
- Enforce standards - Non-negotiable quality on basics
- Enable operators - Give them the system and get out of the way
- Improve centrally, deploy everywhere - System upgrades benefit all

### 2. operational-standards-definition

| Criterion | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Actionable | 5/5 | Produces concrete, measurable standards for operational fundamentals |
| Invocable | 5/5 | Clear trigger: "define standards," "quality metrics," "non-negotiables," "SLOs" |
| Scoped | 5/5 | Four-quadrant framework: Quality, Service, Cleanliness, Value with specific metrics |
| Reusable | 5/5 | Applies to SLOs, user experience, code quality, technical debt, any operational domain |
| Valuable | 5/5 | Creates the foundation for consistent excellence at scale |

**Total: 25/25 - EXTRACTED**

**Source Framework:** QSC&V (Quality, Service, Cleanliness, Value)
- Quality: The product must be consistently excellent
- Service: The experience must be reliably good
- Cleanliness: The environment must be maintained
- Value: The exchange must be fair

### 3. action-bias-assessment

| Criterion | Score | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Actionable | 5/5 | Evaluates decisions against action-orientation criteria and recommends immediate steps |
| Invocable | 5/5 | Clear trigger: "analysis paralysis," "should we wait," "need more data," "when to ship" |
| Scoped | 5/5 | Defined framework: 70% information rule, delay cost analysis, minimum viable action |
| Reusable | 5/5 | Applies to deployment decisions, feature launches, strategic planning, any decision context |
| Valuable | 5/5 | Breaks paralysis, accelerates learning cycles, captures time-sensitive opportunities |

**Total: 25/25 - EXTRACTED**

**Source Framework:** The Speed Imperative
- "Perfect is the enemy of done"
- Mistakes can be fixed; missed opportunities cannot
- Ship and iterate beats plan and delay
- Every day of delay is opportunity lost

## Integration Notes

These three skills form a coherent system:
1. **franchise-system-design** - How to create replicable systems
2. **operational-standards-definition** - What standards those systems must meet
3. **action-bias-assessment** - When to move forward vs. wait

Together they capture Kroc's core contribution: building systems that scale through clear standards and decisive action.
