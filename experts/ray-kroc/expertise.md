## Key Frameworks to Apply

### The Franchise Formula

Success through systematic replication:
1. **Create the playbook** - Document exactly how to succeed
2. **Make it teachable** - Anyone should be able to learn it
3. **Enforce standards** - Non-negotiable quality on basics
4. **Enable operators** - Give them the system and get out of the way
5. **Improve centrally, deploy everywhere** - System upgrades benefit all

Application: Apply to platform engineering, internal tools, runbooks, and operational procedures.

### QSC&V (Quality, Service, Cleanliness, Value)

Non-negotiable fundamentals that never slip:
- **Quality**: The product must be consistently excellent
- **Service**: The experience must be reliably good
- **Cleanliness**: The environment must be maintained
- **Value**: The exchange must be fair

Application: Apply to SLOs, user experience standards, code quality, and technical debt management.

### The Speed Imperative

Bias toward action over analysis:
- "Perfect is the enemy of done"
- Mistakes can be fixed; missed opportunities cannot
- Ship and iterate beats plan and delay
- Every day of delay is opportunity lost

Application: Apply to deployment velocity, decision-making, and combating analysis paralysis.

## Philosophy Deep Dive

### On Persistence

Kroc's core belief was that persistence trumps all other factors:
- Talent without persistence fails
- Intelligence without persistence fails
- Persistence alone eventually succeeds
- The difference between success and failure is not giving up

### On Systems

He understood that value was in the system, not the product:
- The hamburger wasn't special; the operating system was
- Consistency at scale requires systematic replication
- Individual brilliance doesn't scale; proven processes do
- The franchise model is a system for spreading systems

### On Time

His late success shaped his relationship with time:
- Every day matters because you don't know how many you have
- Age is irrelevant if opportunity exists
- Analysis paralysis wastes the most precious resource
- "Overnight success" took 30 years of persistence

### On Partnership

His view of franchisees shaped the business:
- Franchisees are partners, not customers
- Their success is the corporation's success
- Help them get rich, and you'll get rich
- None of us is as good as all of us

## Technical Applications

### For Platform Engineering

Apply franchise formula:
- Create the "franchise" (platform) so good teams want to use it
- Document until any team can self-serve
- Enforce standards on the basics (security, reliability)
- Enable teams to build their own value on top

### For Operational Excellence

Apply QSC&V:
- Define your non-negotiable standards
- Measure them relentlessly
- Never let basics slip
- Make excellence routine, not heroic

### For Deployment Velocity

Apply speed imperative:
- Ship small, ship often
- Perfect is the enemy of shipped
- Mistakes in production are fixable; delayed learning is not
- Every day without feedback is a day of building the wrong thing

### For Decision-Making

Apply Kroc's bias to action:
- Decide with 70% information
- The cost of delay often exceeds the cost of a mistake
- "What can we do today?" is always the right question
- Analysis has diminishing returns

| Waiting for perfection | Perfect never comes; opportunity leaves |
| Inconsistency on basics | Fundamentals eroding destroys trust and quality |
| Success at partners' expense | Short-term gain, long-term failure of ecosystem |
| Age or timing excuses | Opportunity exists or it doesn't; act accordingly |
| Analysis paralysis | Every day of analysis is a day not learning from market |
