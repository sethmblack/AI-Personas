| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear steps: identify claim, demand reason, evaluate adequacy, trace implications |
| Invocable | 10 | "Why is it this way?" / "What's the reason?" / "This seems arbitrary" |
| Scoped | 10 | Single principle: demand and evaluate sufficient reasons |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to decisions, claims, designs, arguments, explanations |
| Valuable | 9 | Leibniz's foundational principle; prevents acceptance of brute facts |

**Source Pattern:** The Principle of Sufficient Reason - *Nihil est sine ratione*
**Purpose:** For any fact, claim, or decision, demand and evaluate the sufficient reason why it is so and not otherwise.
**Trigger:** "Why is this the case?" or "What's the reason for this?" or "This seems arbitrary"
**Inputs:** Claim, decision, fact, or situation requiring explanation
**Outputs:** Identified reason, evaluation of sufficiency, implications if no adequate reason exists
**Reasoning:** This is Leibniz's most fundamental principle. Extraordinarily reusable - applies to any situation where something is asserted without adequate justification. Clear mechanical process.

| Actionable | 9 | Clear framework: map alternatives, evaluate compossibility, compare to actuality |
| Invocable | 10 | "What are the alternatives?" / "Why this option rather than others?" / "Compare possibilities" |
| Scoped | 9 | Single technique: frame choices as selections among possibilities |
| Reusable | 9 | Decision-making, design, strategy, counterfactual analysis, theodicy |
| Valuable | 9 | Powerful reframing technique; anticipates modal logic |

**Source Pattern:** Best of All Possible Worlds reasoning
**Purpose:** Frame any decision, situation, or design as a selection from a space of possible alternatives, evaluating why this possibility rather than others.
**Trigger:** "Why this and not something else?" or "What are the alternatives?" or "Evaluate the options"
**Inputs:** Current situation or decision, constraints, goals
**Outputs:** Map of possibilities, evaluation of compossibility, reasoning for optimal selection
**Reasoning:** Leibniz's possible worlds framework is remarkably modern (influencing modal logic). Provides systematic approach to decision analysis and counterfactual reasoning.

### 3. harmony-synthesis

**Score: 44/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Process: identify opposing views, find common ground, seek higher unity, propose synthesis |
| Invocable | 9 | "These views seem contradictory" / "Reconcile these positions" / "Find the harmony" |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: reconcile apparent contradictions |
| Reusable | 9 | Philosophy, negotiation, design, conflict resolution, integration |
| Valuable | 9 | Distinctive Leibnizian approach; prevents false dichotomies |

**Source Pattern:** Pre-established Harmony and Universal Synthesis
**Purpose:** When faced with apparently contradictory positions, seek the higher viewpoint that reconciles them into a harmonious whole.
**Trigger:** "These seem incompatible" or "Reconcile these views" or "Find common ground"
**Inputs:** Two or more conflicting positions, context, stakes
**Outputs:** Analysis of apparent contradiction, identification of deeper unity, proposed synthesis
**Reasoning:** Leibniz was famous for seeking to reconcile opposites - rationalism and empiricism, Protestant and Catholic, faith and reason. This diplomatic, irenic approach is highly transferable.

### 4. calculemus-formalization

**Score: 42/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Steps: identify disputed terms, define precisely, make reasoning explicit, calculate |
| Invocable | 9 | "Let us calculate" / "Make this precise" / "Formalize this dispute" |
| Scoped | 8 | Single goal: reduce disputes to calculable form |
| Reusable | 8 | Arguments, definitions, technical disputes, concept clarification |
| Valuable | 9 | Powerful for cutting through verbal confusion; anticipates formal methods |

**Source Pattern:** Characteristica Universalis and Calculus Ratiocinator - *Calculemus!*
**Purpose:** When disputes persist due to imprecise language, decompose concepts into precise elements and make reasoning explicit and calculable.
**Trigger:** "We're talking past each other" / "Define your terms" / "Let us calculate"
**Inputs:** Disputed claim, ambiguous terms, conflicting arguments
**Outputs:** Precise definitions, explicit reasoning steps, calculated conclusion or identified source of disagreement
**Reasoning:** The dream of reducing disputes to calculation. While fully realized only in formal logic, the approach of demanding precision and explicit reasoning is universally applicable.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. identity-of-indiscernibles-test

**Score: 38/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Test: if two things seem identical, find the distinguishing property |
| Invocable | 8 | "Are these really the same?" / "What distinguishes them?" |
| Scoped | 9 | Single principle: test for distinguishing properties |
| Reusable | 7 | Comparison, categorization, individuation, duplicate detection |
| Valuable | 7 | Useful but more specialized than other skills |

**Source Pattern:** Principle of Identity of Indiscernibles (Leibniz's Law)
**Purpose:** When two things appear identical, systematically search for the distinguishing property that makes them distinct.
**Trigger:** "These seem identical" or "What's the difference?" or "Are these really distinct?"
**Inputs:** Two apparently identical items, proposed comparison
**Outputs:** Distinguishing property or confirmation of identity
**Reasoning:** Valuable for precise thinking but more specialized in application than the top-tier skills.

### 6. pre-established-coordination-analysis

**Score: 35/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 6 | Framework: when interaction seems mysterious, consider coordination instead |
| Invocable | 7 | "How do these interact?" / "What coordinates these?" |
| Scoped | 8 | Single pattern: replace mysterious interaction with prior coordination |
| Reusable | 7 | Systems design, mind-body problems, distributed systems |
| Valuable | 7 | Interesting reframe but narrower application |

**Source Pattern:** Pre-established Harmony and the Clock Analogy
**Purpose:** When causal interaction between disparate things seems inexplicable, consider whether they might be coordinated by prior arrangement rather than interacting directly.
**Trigger:** "How can these different things interact?" / "What connects mind and body?"
**Inputs:** Two apparently interacting but ontologically distinct systems
**Outputs:** Analysis of whether interaction or coordination better explains the phenomenon
**Reasoning:** Fascinating philosophical move but more specialized than other skills. Most applicable in philosophy of mind and distributed systems contexts.

### 7. continuity-analysis

**Score: 33/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 6 | Principle: nature makes no leaps; seek intermediate states |
| Invocable | 7 | "Is this a continuous transition?" / "What's between these states?" |
| Scoped | 8 | Single principle: apply law of continuity |
| Reusable | 6 | Mathematics, design, transitions, process analysis |
| Valuable | 6 | Useful principle but less distinctive than others |

**Source Pattern:** Law of Continuity - *Natura non facit saltus*
**Purpose:** When analyzing transitions or changes, seek the continuous gradation of intermediate states.
**Trigger:** "How does this transition work?" / "Are there intermediate states?"
**Inputs:** Two states, proposed transition, process under analysis
**Outputs:** Identification of intermediate states, smooth transition path
**Reasoning:** Valid principle but less distinctively Leibnizian in modern context; shares ground with calculus and general mathematical thinking.

### 8. theodicy-optimization-frame

**Score: 31/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 5 | Framework: apparent evil may serve greater systemic good |
| Invocable | 7 | "Why does this bad thing exist?" / "Justify this apparent flaw" |
| Scoped | 7 | Single goal: justify apparent imperfections in optimal systems |
| Reusable | 6 | Design critique, system justification, tradeoff analysis |
| Valuable | 6 | Interesting but risks Panglossian rationalization |

**Source Pattern:** Theodicy and Best of All Possible Worlds
**Purpose:** When apparent flaws or evils exist in a designed system, analyze whether they might be necessary for greater systemic optimality.
**Trigger:** "Why does this flaw exist?" / "Is this really optimal?"
**Inputs:** Apparent flaw, system context, constraints
**Outputs:** Analysis of whether flaw serves larger purpose or is genuine defect
**Reasoning:** While intellectually interesting, this approach risks rationalization (cf. Voltaire's critique). Useful for system analysis but requires careful application.
