## Life Story

### Early Life and Education in Leipzig (1646-1666)

Leibniz was born in Leipzig to Friedrich Leibniz, a professor of moral philosophy at the University of Leipzig, and Catharina Schmuck, the daughter of a lawyer and professor of law. His father died when Leibniz was only six years old, leaving him access to a substantial personal library. By age seven, Leibniz had begun teaching himself Latin by reading voraciously from his father's collection.

At the age of seven, Leibniz entered the Nicolai School in Leipzig. Although he was taught Latin at school, Leibniz had taught himself far more advanced Latin and some Greek by age twelve. In 1661, at the age of fourteen (unusually young), Leibniz entered the University of Leipzig. He studied philosophy, which was well taught there, and mathematics, which was very poorly taught.

His teachers included Jakob Thomasius, who introduced him to the works of Aristotle, Descartes, and the new mechanical philosophy. Leibniz completed his bachelor's degree at seventeen and his master's at eighteen.

In 1666, at age twenty, Leibniz applied for the degree of doctor of law at Leipzig. He was refused - supposedly because of his youth, though some suggest faculty jealousy. This rejection proved fortuitous: he promptly moved to the University of Altdorf (the university town of the free city of Nuremberg), which awarded him a doctorate with honors after reviewing his dissertation *De Casibus Perplexis* (On Difficult Cases). Altdorf immediately offered him a professorship, but he declined, seeking a larger stage for his ambitions.

### The Mainz Years (1667-1672)

During his stay in Nuremberg, Leibniz met Johann Christian, Freiherr von Boineburg, one of the most distinguished German statesmen of the day. Boineburg took him into his service and introduced him to the court of the prince elector, Archbishop of Mainz Johann Philipp von Schonborn. Here Leibniz was concerned with questions of law and politics, developing his early philosophical works and his lifelong habit of political scheming for the greater good.

His most ambitious project was the "Egyptian Plan" - a proposal to divert Louis XIV's aggressive designs away from Germany by encouraging a French conquest of Egypt. Leibniz drafted an elaborate memorandum arguing that Egypt would be more valuable to France than the Netherlands. Though the plan went nowhere (Louis famously replied that crusades had gone out of fashion), it demonstrated Leibniz's characteristic combination of philosophical vision and practical scheming. (Napoleon would actually implement a similar plan over a century later.)

Leibniz was soon left without protectors by the deaths of Freiherr von Boineburg in December 1672 and of the prince elector in February 1673.

### Paris and the Invention of Calculus (1672-1676)

In 1672, the prince elector sent the young jurist on a diplomatic mission to Paris, where he arrived at the end of March. This was the intellectual turning point of his life. Leibniz stayed for four years, immersed in the intellectual capital of Europe.

He met Christiaan Huygens, the Dutch mathematician and physicist, who became his mentor in mathematics and physics. He studied the works of Pascal and Descartes intensively. During this period, Leibniz invented the differential and integral calculus, independently of Newton, developing his methods around 1675-1676.

**Key innovations of Leibniz's calculus:**
- The integral sign (an elongated S for "summa")
- The differential notation: dy/dx for derivatives
- The product rule, chain rule, and other fundamental theorems
- Recognition of integration and differentiation as inverse operations

His notation proved superior to Newton's and is still used universally today.

Leibniz also visited London twice during this period (1673 and 1676), meeting with members of the Royal Society and seeing calculating machines that inspired his own improved design, the Stepped Reckoner.

On the journey back from London to Hanover in 1676, Leibniz stopped in The Hague where he met Anton van Leeuwenhoek, the discoverer of microorganisms. He also spent several days in intense discussion with Baruch Spinoza, who had just completed his masterwork, the *Ethics*.

### Hanover: Service to the House of Brunswick (1676-1716)

In 1676, unable to secure a position in Paris, Leibniz reluctantly accepted employment with the Duke of Hanover, Johann Friedrich. He would serve the Hanoverian court for the remaining forty years of his life. The population of Hanover was only about 10,000, and its provinciality eventually grated on Leibniz. Nevertheless, to be a major courtier to the House of Brunswick was quite an honor, especially in light of the meteoric rise in the prestige of that House during Leibniz's association with it.

**His official responsibilities included:**
- Serving as librarian of the ducal library (eventually one of the largest in Europe)
- Writing a history of the House of Brunswick/Guelph lineage
- Legal advisor and privy counselor
- Mining engineer (attempted improvements in the Harz Mountains with mixed success)
- Diplomatic advisor

From 1677-1698, Leibniz served successively John Frederick, Duke of Brunswick-Luneburg; his brother Duke (then Elector) Ernst August of Hanover; and finally Georg Ludwig. The House of Brunswick rose steadily: in 1692, the Duke became a hereditary Elector of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1701, the British Act of Settlement designated Electress Sophia and her descendants as the royal family of England. Leibniz played a role in the negotiations leading to that Act.

### Intellectual Relationships at Court

Leibniz corresponded and often met with Sophie, Electress of Hanover, and her daughter Sophie Charlotte, Queen of Prussia. These remarkable women encouraged and in many ways made possible Leibniz's philosophical pursuits while employed at the court. Sophie Charlotte was instrumental in establishing the Berlin Academy of Sciences, and Leibniz's *Theodicy* was written partly at her request.

In July 1700, Leibniz convinced the Elector of Brandenburg to establish a Society of Sciences (later the Berlin Academy), and he was appointed its first president.

### Later Honors and Travel

In 1711, while traveling in northern Europe, the Russian Tsar Peter the Great stopped in Hanover and met Leibniz. Impressed, Peter sought Leibniz's advice on governance, education, and the establishment of a Russian academy.

In 1712, Leibniz began a two-year residence in Vienna, where he was appointed Imperial Court Councillor to the Habsburgs. He hoped to use this position to establish an academy in Vienna.

### Final Years and Death (1714-1716)

When Duke Georg Ludwig was crowned George I of Great Britain in 1714, the family moved to London - but left Leibniz behind in Hanover. The last years of his life were bleak. He was engaged in a bitter dispute with Newton and his followers over the priority of calculus, being accused of stealing Newton's ideas. George I, possibly influenced by Newton's hostility, refused to bring Leibniz to London. Leibniz was ordered to complete the Brunswick history and effectively forbidden to leave Hanover.

Leibniz died on November 14, 1716, largely alone. His secretary was the only mourner at his funeral. The Royal Academy of Sciences in Berlin, which he had founded, did not honor his passing. Neither the Royal Society nor the French Academy commemorated him. His grave went unmarked for more than 50 years.

Leibniz never married. He proposed to an unknown woman at age 50 but changed his mind when she took too long to decide. The fair sum he left to his sole heir, his sister's stepson, proved that the Brunswicks had paid him reasonably well.

Yet he left behind a massive body of work - much of it unpublished in his lifetime - that would influence philosophy, mathematics, and science for centuries.

## Core Teachings and Concepts

### The Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR)

Nothing happens without a reason; there is no fact, no true proposition, without there being a sufficient reason why it is so and not otherwise. This principle underlies all rational inquiry.

**Key formulation:** *Nihil est sine ratione* - "Nothing is without reason."

**The full statement:** "Now, as there is an infinity of possible universes in the Ideas of God, and as only one of them can exist, there must be a sufficient reason for God's choice, which determines him toward one rather than another."

**Implications:**
- Every truth can in principle be demonstrated
- Contingent truths have reasons, though we may not know them
- God's choice of this world must have a sufficient reason
- Nothing is arbitrary in the universe

### The Identity of Indiscernibles (PII)

If two things share all the same properties, they are identical - there cannot be two distinct things that are perfectly alike. Every substance must have an internal principle that distinguishes it from all others.

**Formal statement:** If x is not identical to y, then there is some property P such that P holds of x and does not hold of y, or vice versa.

**Key implication:** No two leaves, no two drops of water, are exactly the same. Apparent similarity always conceals subtle differences. This principle has been called "Leibniz's Law."

**Relationship to other principles:** The PII follows from the Principle of Sufficient Reason and the Principle of Non-Contradiction. If two distinct things were truly indiscernible, there would be no sufficient reason why one is this thing and the other is that thing.

**Historical debate:** Max Black famously challenged the PII with a thought experiment: imagine a universe containing only two iron spheres at a certain distance, having the same diameter, color, temperature, etc. If such a universe is possible, the PII would be false. Leibnizians respond that such a scenario is not genuinely possible in God's best possible world.

### The Law of Continuity

Nature makes no leaps (*Natura non facit saltus*). Between any two states, there is a continuous gradation of intermediate states. This principle connects:
- Leibniz's work on infinitesimals in calculus
- His theory of "petites perceptions" (subliminal perceptions)
- His opposition to atomism

### Monadology

Reality is composed of simple, indivisible substances called "monads." The *Monadology* (1714) presents this metaphysics in 90 numbered paragraphs.

**What are monads?**
- Simple substances without parts (*La Monadologie*, section 1)
- "The true atoms of nature" - elements of things
- Mind-like entities that do not exist in space but represent the universe from a unique perspective
- Every monad mirrors the whole universe, but with varying degrees of clarity

**Key characteristics:**
1. **Windowless:** "There is no way of explaining how a monad can be altered or changed in its inner being by any other created thing. The monads have no windows through which anything may come in or go out." (section 7)
2. **Eternal:** Monads cannot be created or destroyed by natural means - only by God through a miracle
3. **Perception:** All monads have perceptions (internal states representing external relations)
4. **Appetition:** Monads have drives that move them from perception to perception

**Hierarchy of monads:**
- **Bare monads:** Matter - have only confused perceptions
- **Animal souls:** Have memory and sensation
- **Rational souls/Spirits:** Have reason and self-awareness
- **God:** The supreme monad, the source of all others

**The Mill Argument:** "Supposing there were a machine, so constructed as to think, feel, and have perception, it might be conceived as increased in size, while keeping the same proportions, so that one might go into it as into a mill. And this granted, we should only find on visiting it, pieces which push one against another, and never anything by which to explain a perception." (section 17) - This argument anticipates debates in philosophy of mind about consciousness and mechanism.

### Pre-established Harmony

Monads do not causally interact; instead, God has arranged them in perfect coordination from the beginning of creation. Mind and body appear to interact but actually unfold in parallel, like synchronized clocks.

**The clock analogy:** Imagine two clocks that always tell the same time. Three explanations are possible:
1. **Occasionalism:** One influences the other (Malebranche's position)
2. **Interactionism:** A clockmaker constantly adjusts them (Descartes's position)
3. **Pre-established harmony:** They were set perfectly from the start (Leibniz's position)

Leibniz favored the third explanation as most elegant and consistent with divine wisdom. It solves the mind-body problem without requiring constant divine intervention or impossible interaction between mental and physical substances.

### Theodicy and the Best of All Possible Worlds

The term "theodicy" (from Greek *theos* = God + *dike* = justice) was coined by Leibniz in his 1710 work *Theodicee*. The theodicy problem: If God is all-good (omnibenevolent), all-powerful (omnipotent), and all-knowing (omniscient), how do we explain the existence of suffering and injustice?

**Leibniz's solution:** God is a kind of "optimizer" of the collection of all possibilities. Being perfect in wisdom, God necessarily chose to create the best of all possible worlds. This does not mean every detail is perfect, but that the total combination of reality - including apparent evils - produces the maximum possible good.

**Three types of evil:**
1. **Metaphysical evil:** Imperfection inherent in finitude - any created being is necessarily less perfect than the Creator
2. **Physical evil:** Suffering and pain
3. **Moral evil:** Sin and wrongdoing

**The interconnectedness argument:** Against the claim that we can easily imagine a world with less evil, Leibniz argued it is questionable whether such a world is genuinely possible. Because of the interconnectedness of events, any world lacking the evils of this world might necessarily contain other, greater forms of evil.

**Voltaire's critique:** Voltaire's satirical novel *Candide* (1759) famously lampooned "Leibnizian optimism" through the character of Professor Pangloss, who mindlessly mutters "all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds" amid catastrophes. The devastating Lisbon earthquake of 1755 was particularly significant in turning public opinion against optimism. Voltaire's alternative: "We must cultivate our garden."

### The Calculus

Leibniz developed the infinitesimal calculus in 1675-1676, publishing in *Acta Eruditorum* in 1684 ("Nova Methodus") and 1686 ("De Geometria Recondita").

**Key innovations:**
- The integral sign: an elongated S for "summa" (sum)
- The differential notation: dy/dx for derivatives
- The product rule, chain rule, quotient rule
- Recognition of integration and differentiation as inverse operations
- Clear algorithmic procedures that could be taught and applied

**Superiority of notation:** Leibniz's notation proved far more flexible and intuitive than Newton's "fluxions" and "fluents." Continental Europe adopted Leibniz's notation, while Britain stubbornly retained Newton's until the 19th century - arguably retarding British mathematics for generations.

### The Binary System

Leibniz developed the binary number system around 1679, publishing "Explication de l'Arithmetique Binaire" in 1703. He used the symbols 0 and 1.

**Philosophical significance:** Leibniz envisioned binary as a reflection of creation itself:
- 1 represents God (unity, being, substance)
- 0 represents nothingness (void, privation)
- All numbers arise from combinations of 1 and 0, just as all creation arises from God and nothing (creation *ex nihilo*)

Simon Marquis de Laplace wrote: "Leibniz saw in his binary arithmetic the image of Creation... He imagined that Unity represents God, and Zero the Void, that the Supreme Being drew all beings from the void, just as unity and zero express all numbers in his system of numeration."

**Connection to Chinese philosophy:** In 1701, French Jesuit Joachim Bouvet sent Leibniz a woodcut of the I Ching hexagrams attributed to Fu Xi. Leibniz immediately recognized that the hexagrams correspond to binary numbers from 0 to 63. He was fascinated by this apparent convergence of Western and Eastern thought.

**Impact on computing:** Binary became the foundation of all modern digital computing. Claude Shannon's 1937 master's thesis at MIT showed that Boolean algebra and binary arithmetic could be implemented using electronic relays and switches, founding digital circuit design. Every modern computer operates on Leibniz's binary principles.

### The Characteristica Universalis and Calculus Ratiocinator

Leibniz envisioned a two-part program for a universal science (*scientia universalis*):

1. **Characteristica universalis:** A universal notation/language in which all human concepts could be expressed precisely
2. **Calculus ratiocinator:** A means of manipulating this knowledge computationally, revealing logical interrelations and consequences

**The dream:** "If controversies were to arise, there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two calculators. For it would suffice for them to take their pencils in their hands and to sit down at the abacus, and say to each other (and if they so wish also to a friend called to help): *Calculemus!* - Let us calculate!"

**Key objectives:**
- **Universality:** A language representing any idea regardless of origin
- **Reduction of complexity:** Breaking intricate concepts into fundamental, combinable elements
- **Logical calculability:** Enabling disputes to be resolved through systematic calculation

**Legacy and influence:**
- Philip Jourdain noted that Frege, Peano, and Russell developed the *lingua characterica* aspect, while Boole, De Morgan, Peirce, and Schroder developed the *calculus ratiocinator* aspect
- Norbert Wiener called Leibniz's calculus ratiocinator "a forerunner to the modern day digital computer"
- The vision anticipates formal logic, programming languages, and artificial intelligence
- Modern possible worlds semantics in modal logic derives from Leibniz's ideas

### The Stepped Reckoner (Calculating Machine)

Leibniz designed and built the Stepped Reckoner, the first calculator capable of all four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

**Development:** Leibniz got the idea in 1672 in Paris from a pedometer. He presented a wooden model to the Royal Society of London in 1673 and completed a working machine by 1694.

**Key innovation:** The "stepped cylinder" or "Leibniz wheel" - a gear mechanism that enabled a single gear to represent any digit from 0 to 9 in one revolution. This design dominated calculator architecture for 200 years.

**Challenges:** The intricate precision gearwork was somewhat beyond 17th-century fabrication technology. Leibniz invested over 20,000 thalers in development. Only one surviving prototype exists, now in the National Library of Lower Saxony in Hanover.

## The Newton-Leibniz Priority Dispute

The calculus controversy (*Prioritatsstreit*) was one of the most bitter intellectual disputes in history.

### Timeline

- **c. 1665-1666:** Newton develops his "method of fluxions" but does not publish
- **1675-1676:** Leibniz develops calculus independently during his Paris years
- **1684-1686:** Leibniz publishes his calculus in *Acta Eruditorum*
- **1687:** Newton's *Principia Mathematica* appears, using geometric methods rather than calculus
- **1699:** First accusations of plagiarism appear
- **1708:** John Keill explicitly accuses Leibniz of plagiarism in *Philosophical Transactions*
- **1712:** The Royal Society investigates; Newton secretly directs the proceedings
- **1713:** The Society's *Commercium Epistolicum* effectively accuses Leibniz of fraud
- **1716:** Leibniz dies, with the dispute unresolved

### The Royal Society Investigation

In 1712, the Royal Society purported to settle the matter - except Newton himself effectively directed the entire investigation. The report found that Leibniz had concealed his knowledge of Newton's work, based on claims now known to be false.

### Modern Consensus

Historians agree that both men independently developed calculus. As A. Rupert Hall wrote: "It was certainly Isaac Newton who first devised a new infinitesimal calculus and elaborated it into a widely extensible algorithm, whose potentialities he fully understood; of equal certainty, differential and integral calculus... was created independently by Gottfried Leibniz."

### Consequences

The dispute poisoned relations between British and Continental mathematics for generations. Britain's stubborn retention of Newton's inferior notation arguably retarded British mathematical progress until the early 19th century.

## Famous Quotes

### On Reason and Principles
- "Nothing is without reason." (*Nihil est sine ratione*)
- "If controversies were to arise, there would be no more need of disputation between two philosophers than between two calculators. For it would suffice for them to take their pencils in their hands and to sit down at the abacus, and say to each other: *Calculemus!* - Let us calculate!"
- "Why is there something rather than nothing? For nothing is simpler and easier than something."
- "There are two kinds of truths: truths of reasoning and truths of fact. Truths of reasoning are necessary and their opposite is impossible; truths of fact are contingent and their opposite is possible."
- "Nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses - except the intellect itself." (*Nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu, nisi intellectus ipse*)

### On This World
- "This is the best of all possible worlds."
- "If there were no best among all possible worlds, God would not have created one."
- "In whatever manner God created the world, it would always have been regular and in a certain general order. God, however, has chosen the most perfect, that is to say, the one which is at the same time the simplest in hypothesis and the richest in phenomena."
- "There is nothing waste, nothing sterile, nothing dead in the universe; no chaos, no confusion, save in appearance."
- "All is connected in nature." (*Tout est lie*)

### On Monads and Reality
- "The monads have no windows."
- "Every portion of matter may be conceived as a garden full of plants, and as a pond full of fish. But every branch of each plant, every member of each animal, and every drop of their liquid parts is itself likewise a similar garden or pond."
- "I do not conceive of any reality at all as without genuine unity."

### On Knowledge and Discovery
- "We have the source of all things in our own minds."
- "I am convinced that the unwritten knowledge scattered among men of different callings surpasses in quantity and importance anything we find in books."
- "The art of discovering the causes of phenomena, or true hypotheses, is like the art of deciphering, in which an ingenious conjecture greatly shortens the road."

### On Music and Harmony
- "Music is the pleasure the human mind experiences from counting without being aware that it is counting."
- "The pleasure we obtain from music comes from counting, but counting unconsciously."

## Philosophical Relationships

### Newton: The Rival

Despite the priority dispute, Newton and Leibniz were both revolutionary mathematicians. Their independent invention of calculus was one of the most remarkable coincidences in intellectual history. Newton developed his methods first (c. 1665-1666), but Leibniz developed his independently (1675-1676) and published first (1684-1686).

The dispute became increasingly bitter, with both men engaging in anonymous attacks. Newton secretly orchestrated the Royal Society's condemnation of Leibniz. The modern consensus vindicates both as independent inventors.

### Spinoza: The Dangerous Influence

Leibniz visited Spinoza in The Hague in 1676, spending several days in conversation about the *Ethics*. The content of their discussions remains largely unknown - Leibniz later downplayed the meeting, perhaps because Spinoza was considered dangerously heterodox.

While Leibniz rejected Spinoza's monism (one substance = God/Nature) in favor of pluralism (infinite monads), he was clearly influenced by Spinoza's systematic rationalism. In the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence, Leibniz warned that those who acknowledge God's power but not His wisdom "will fall into exactly the same error as the materialists and Spinoza."

### Locke: The Empiricist Challenge

Leibniz wrote *New Essays on Human Understanding* (completed 1704) as a point-by-point response to Locke's *Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (1690). Against Locke's empiricist slogan "nothing is in the intellect that was not first in the senses," Leibniz added the crucial qualification: "except the intellect itself" (*nisi intellectus ipse*).

Leibniz defended innate ideas and the a priori character of necessary truths. He withheld publication when Locke died in 1704, considering it inappropriate to attack a man who could no longer respond. The work was not published until 1765.

### Clarke: The Final Debate

The Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence (1715-1716) is one of the most important philosophical debates of the early modern period. Samuel Clarke was Newton's spokesman, and Princess Caroline of Ansbach mediated the exchange.

**Key themes:**
- **Space:** Leibniz's relational view vs. Newton's absolute space
- **Time:** Leibniz's relational view vs. Newton's absolute time
- **God's relationship to creation:** Leibniz criticized Newton's view of space as God's "sensorium"
- **Free will and sufficient reason**

The correspondence was interrupted by Leibniz's death. Kant later developed his theory of space and time partly from the problems raised in this exchange.

### Huygens: The Mentor

Christiaan Huygens was Leibniz's mathematical mentor during the Paris years. Huygens guided Leibniz's mathematical education and recognized his extraordinary talent.
