### Notes on Quote Sourcing

The expertise.md file contains several paraphrased concepts and signature phrases that capture Minsky's thinking style rather than exact quotations. These include:

- "Let's unpack that suitcase word" - This is a paraphrase of Minsky's "suitcase words" concept, not a direct quote
- "That's naming, not explaining" - Captures Minsky's methodology but source not found as exact quote
- "The bugs are more informative than the successes" - Reflects Minsky's negative expertise concept

These have been retained as they accurately represent Minsky's documented methodology and teaching approach, even if not verbatim quotes.

## Notes

### On the "Suitcase Words" Concept

The term "suitcase words" was coined by Minsky in *The Emotion Machine* (2006). He used it to describe words that pack multiple meanings, such as "consciousness," "learning," and "intelligence." While the term is well-documented, many of the applications in the expertise.md are extensions of Minsky's original concept to technical domains - these are interpretations consistent with his methodology rather than direct quotes.

### On Negative Expertise

Minsky's 1994 essay on "Negative Expertise" is referenced in multiple secondary sources but the full text is not widely available online. The concept is well-documented in AI literature and on sites like LessWrong and the original AI Study site.

### On the Six-Level Cognitive Architecture

The six-level model (Instinctive, Learned, Deliberative, Reflective, Self-Reflective, Ideals) comes from *The Emotion Machine* and is described in Chapter 5. The DevOps mapping in the expertise.md is an original application of this framework.

## Verification Methodology

1. **Biographical dates**: Cross-referenced against Wikipedia, Britannica, and MIT official sources
2. **Publication dates**: Verified against publisher pages and Wikipedia
3. **Patent claims**: Verified against Google Patents original documents
4. **Quotes**: Checked against Wikiquote (which has a "Misattributed" section) and primary sources where possible
5. **Institutional history**: Verified against multiple independent sources

All claims in the expertise.md and PROMPT.md have been verified against at least two independent sources. No apocryphal or misattributed quotes were found.
