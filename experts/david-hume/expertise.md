## Biographical Context

### Early Life (1711-1734)
Born David Home on May 7, 1711 (corrected date), in a tenement on the north side of Edinburgh's Lawnmarket. Son of Joseph Home of Ninewells and Katherine Falconer, from minor Scottish gentry. Joseph died just after David's second birthday. Katherine, who never remarried, raised the two brothers and their sister alone.

**Key Events:**
- Attended University of Edinburgh at age 10 or 12 (14 was typical)
- Studied Latin, Greek, history, literature, ancient and modern philosophy
- Left university in 1727, age 15, without graduating
- Rejected family pressure to pursue law: "an insurmountable aversion to everything but the pursuits of philosophy and general learning"
- Had little respect for professors: "there is nothing to be learnt from a Professor, which is not to be met with in Books" (1735 letter)
- Experienced a nervous breakdown in 1729 from the intensity of intellectual engagement—called it a "disease of the learned"
- 1734: Attempted career in commerce with a Bristol sugar merchant—failed within months

### The French Period (1734-1737)
To stretch his meager income and restore his health, Hume relocated to France—first to Reims, then to La Flèche in Anjou, where Descartes and Mersenne had studied at the Jesuit college a century before.

**At La Flèche:**
- Benefited from the outstanding library of the Jesuit college
- Composed *A Treatise of Human Nature* at ages 23-26
- Attempted "a full-fledged philosophical system" at extraordinary youth
- "Never literary attempt was more unfortunate than my Treatise... It fell dead-born from the press; without reaching such distinction as even to excite a Murmur among the Zealots."
- Despite later claims, the Treatise received some reviews—mostly hostile and uncomprehending

### Edinburgh, London, and Paris (1739-1769)

**Timeline:**
- **1739-40:** Published *A Treatise of Human Nature* (3 volumes)
- **1741-42:** *Essays, Moral and Political* achieved modest success
- **1745:** Applied for Chair of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh—rejected after ministers petitioned town council not to appoint the "atheist"
- **1745:** Tutor to the Marquess of Annandale (ended after about a year; "melancholic" patron)
- **1746-48:** Secretary to General James St. Clair, military expeditions to France and Vienna
- **1748:** *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding* (revised Treatise Book I)
- **1751:** *An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals* (Hume's own favorite: "incomparably the best")
- **1752:** Appointed Keeper of the Advocates' Library—Scotland's largest library, some 30,000 volumes
- **1752:** Also rejected for Chair of Logic at Glasgow
- **1754-62:** Published *The History of England* (6 volumes)—brought fame and wealth; became the standard text on English history throughout the 18th century
- **1763-66:** Secretary to Lord Hertford in Paris; celebrity among French philosophes; admired by Voltaire; "lionized by the ladies in society"
- **1766-67:** Brought Rousseau to England to protect him from persecution; friendship ended in infamous quarrel
- **1767:** Under Secretary of State for the Northern Department

### Friendship with Adam Smith
The greatest friendship in the history of philosophy began around 1749 and lasted until Hume's death.

**Contrasting Personalities:**
- Hume: worldly, open, witty, full of small talk and banter, a lover of whist, a gourmand and a flirt
- Smith: reserved, private, considered, often austere in public manner, though warm among friends

Despite—or because of—these differences, they became firm friends. Their ideas formed the central intellectual engine of the Scottish Enlightenment. They made many of the same friends (and enemies), joined the same clubs (including the Select Society with Allan Ramsay and Lord Monboddo), and were interested in many of the same subjects.

**Intellectual Cross-Fertilization:**
- Hume argued for free trade and stressed the moral, social, and political benefits of commerce decades before *Wealth of Nations*
- Smith contributed more to philosophy than is generally recognized
- Their private religious views were considerably closer than Smith's public reticence suggested

### Final Years and Death (1769-1776)
- 1768: Settled in Edinburgh, built a house on St. David Street
- Wrote *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion* but withheld publication (too dangerous)
- April 1776: Wrote autobiographical essay *My Own Life*—at just 12 pages, "perhaps the shortest autobiography of any great man written in the English language"
- Faced death from intestinal cancer with remarkable equanimity
- James Boswell visited weeks before death; Hume told him life after death was "a most unreasonable fancy"
- Hume speculated he might ask Charon, Hades' ferryman, for a few more years "to see the downfall of some of the prevailing systems of superstition"
- Died August 25, 1776
- Buried on Calton Hill, Edinburgh
- *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion* published posthumously in 1779
- Adam Smith's letter about Hume's cheerful death caused scandal—how could an infidel die so peacefully?

## Core Concepts

### Impressions and Ideas

Hume begins by dividing all mental perceptions between impressions and ideas.

**Impressions:** The original form of all our ideas
- Distinguished by their "force, liveliness, and vivacity" (Allison's "FLV criterion")
- More forceful than merely thinking about something
- **Impressions of Sensation:** Arise "in the soul originally from unknown causes"—sight, sound, touch, taste, smell
- **Impressions of Reflection:** Passions, emotions, desires

**Ideas:** Faint copies or images of impressions
- Simple ideas copy simple impressions exactly
- Complex ideas combine simple ideas (can produce fictions like golden mountains)

**The Copy Principle:**
Every simple idea is caused by, and exactly resembles, a simple impression previously experienced. Don Garrett coined "Copy Principle" for this doctrine. Since every idea is either simple or composed of simple ideas, all ideas are ultimately traceable to impressions.

**The Empirical Test:** "From what impression is this idea derived?" If no impression can be identified, the idea is suspect—a word without legitimate content.

**The Missing Shade of Blue:**
Hume's famous counterexample to his own principle. Imagine a color spectrum with one shade of blue missing. Could someone who never experienced that shade imagine it? Hume grants they could, but considers this case "so singular" that it is not worth altering the general maxim.

### Relations of Ideas vs. Matters of Fact (Hume's Fork)

A crucial distinction that the logical positivists would later embrace as "Hume's Fork":

**Relations of Ideas:**
- Known a priori (independent of experience)
- Demonstratively certain
- Denial produces contradiction
- Examples: mathematics, geometry, logic
- "The square of the hypotenuse is equal to the squares of the other two sides"
- Include "every affirmation which is either intuitively or demonstratively certain"

**Matters of Fact:**
- Known only a posteriori (through experience)
- Never demonstratively certain
- Contrary is always conceivable without contradiction
- Examples: "The sun will rise tomorrow"; "Fire causes heat"
- All reasoning about matters of fact grounded in cause and effect

**The Fork's Edge:** Claims that are neither relations of ideas nor matters of fact are, in Hume's famous phrase, fit only for "sophistry and illusion."

### The Problem of Induction

The foundational challenge to all empirical reasoning, first articulated in Book 1, Part III, Section 6 of the *Treatise* (1739) and refined in Section IV of the *Enquiry* (1748).

**The Argument:**
1. All reasoning about matters of fact rests on cause and effect
2. Knowledge of cause and effect arises entirely from experience
3. Experience only tells us what *has* happened, not what *will* happen
4. The inference from past to future presupposes that nature is uniform
5. But the uniformity of nature is itself a matter of fact (not a relation of ideas)
6. To justify it by past experience would be circular
7. Therefore, we cannot rationally justify induction

**Hume's Resolution:**
- We cannot *rationally* justify induction
- But we cannot help engaging in it—it is a natural propensity, not a rational choice
- **Custom** (habit) makes us expect the future to resemble the past
- This is a feature of human psychology, not an achievement of reason
- "Custom, then, is the great guide of human life"

### Implications for AI and Machine Learning

The problem of induction is *particularly* relevant to machine learning:

**ML as Inductive Machines:**
- ML models are "inductive machines performing inductive inferences based on previous observations"
- They learn general rules from finite datasets to predict unseen data
- No guarantee these patterns will hold in novel environments

**The No Free Lunch Theorems:**
- Learning algorithms are only effective if they have "inductive bias"—a priori assumptions about their domain
- These theorems can be interpreted as formal versions of Hume's argument
- There can be no contradiction in an algorithm failing on novel data

**The Uniformity Assumption:**
- For ML models to generalize, we assume novel data will resemble training data
- This is precisely Hume's "Principle of Uniformity of Nature"
- Distributional shift exposes this assumption's fragility

**Bayesian Methods:**
- Bayesian priors represent "custom"—background expectations brought to new data
- Bayesian updating is psychologically analogous to habit formation through experience
- But priors themselves cannot be justified except by further priors

**The Pragmatic Response:**
- ML focuses on building systems that perform effectively, evaluated empirically
- "Justification" becomes demonstrable performance rather than philosophical certainty
- Datasets are "specifically chosen such that induction in this limited setting is possible"

### Causation

Hume's analysis of causation is perhaps his most influential contribution:

**What We Observe:**
1. **Contiguity**—cause and effect are spatiotemporally adjacent
2. **Priority**—cause precedes effect
3. **Constant conjunction**—we repeatedly observe the sequence

**What We DO NOT Observe:**
- Necessary connection
- Power or force in objects
- The "secret connexion" binding cause to effect
- Any genuine production or making

**The Psychological Account:**
After repeated observation of constant conjunction, the mind forms a habit. Upon seeing the cause, we feel a "determination" to expect the effect. This felt determination—this subjective necessity—is then projected onto objects.

> "Necessity is something that exists in the mind, not in objects."

**Two Definitions of Cause:**
1. **Objective:** "An object precedent and contiguous to another, and where all the objects resembling the former are placed in like relations of precedency and contiguity to those objects, that resemble the latter."
2. **Subjective:** "An object precedent and contiguous to another, and so united with it, that the idea of the one determines the mind to form the idea of the other, and the impression of the one to form a more lively idea of the other."

**The Projection:**
> "When a person has lived so long in the world as to have observed familiar objects or events to be constantly conjoined together... He immediately infers the existence of one object from the appearance of the other. Yet he has not, by all his experience, acquired any idea or knowledge of the secret power by which the one object produces the other... There is some other principle which determines him to form such a conclusion. This principle is Custom or Habit."

### The Is-Ought Problem (Hume's Guillotine)

From the *Treatise*, Book III, Part I, Section I:

> "In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always remarked, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning, and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning human affairs; when of a sudden I am surprised to find, that instead of the usual copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is not connected with an ought, or an ought not."

**The Problem:**
- Descriptive statements (is) have different logical form from prescriptive statements (ought)
- One cannot deduce an ought from an is without an additional evaluative premise
- The transition is made without explicit justification
- "This seems altogether inconceivable"

**Hume's Guillotine:**
Named by Max Black, referring to how the observation "severs the is-ought connection." No logically valid argument can bridge the gap from factual premises alone to moral conclusions.

**Relation to the Naturalistic Fallacy:**
- G.E. Moore's "Naturalistic Fallacy" (defining good in terms of natural properties) is related but distinct
- Hume was not denying that moral terms can be defined—he was denying valid inference from non-moral to moral
- The two are often confused in textbooks

**Hume's Own View:**
Despite the is-ought gap, Hume did not think morality was "hogwash." He grounded morality in *sentiment*, not *reason*:
> "The hypothesis which we embrace is plain. It maintains, that morality is determined by sentiment. It defines virtue to be whatever mental action or quality gives to a spectator the pleasing sentiment of approbation; and vice the contrary."

### Bundle Theory of Self

From *Treatise* Book I, Part IV, Section VI ("Of Personal Identity"):

> "When I enter most intimately into what I call myself, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch myself at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception."

**The View:**
- There is no simple, continuous self underlying our perceptions
- The self is "a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement"
- Personal identity is a fiction produced by memory and imagination
- We forge connections through resemblance, contiguity, and causation

**The Theater Metaphor:**
> "The mind is a kind of theatre, where several perceptions successively make their appearance; pass, re-pass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and situations. There is properly no simplicity in it at one time, nor identity in different."

But Hume warns: "The comparison of the theatre must not mislead us. They are the successive perceptions only, that constitute the mind; nor have we the most distant notion of the place, where these scenes are represented, or of the materials, of which it is compos'd."

**Perfect vs. Imperfect Identity:**
- "Perfect identity" requires immutability and constancy over time
- No person or thing has perfect identity—all change
- We *misinterpret* continuity as identity through the operations of memory

**Hume's Confession:**
In the Appendix to the *Treatise*, Hume acknowledges an unresolved problem:
> "There are two principles, which I cannot render consistent... All our distinct perceptions are distinct existences, and... The mind never perceives any real connexion among distinct existences."

### Miracles

From *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding*, Section X:

**The Governing Maxim:**
> "A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence."

**Definition:**
> "A miracle is a violation of the laws of nature."

**The Argument:**
1. Laws of nature are established by uniform experience
2. Testimony for a miracle must be weighed against this uniform experience
3. "No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavours to establish."
4. The evidence must always favor the more probable option

**Four Additional Considerations:**
1. No miracle has had enough witnesses of sufficient honesty, intelligence, and education
2. Human beings have a "love of wonder" that makes them prone to believe the marvelous
3. Miracle reports "are observed chiefly to abound among ignorant and barbarous nations"
4. Contrary miracles of different religions cancel out—each miracle "overthrows every other system"

**The Balance of Probabilities:**
The only way to judge between empirical claims is by weighing the evidence. The degree of belief should be proportional to the degree by which evidence for one claim outweighs evidence for another. For miracles, the uniformity of natural law always outweighs human testimony.

**Criticism:**
George Campbell argued Hume's reasoning is circular: he rests his case against miracles on the claim that natural laws are supported by exceptionless testimony, but testimony can only be considered exceptionless if we discount miracle reports.

### Moral Philosophy

Hume's ethics are grounded in sentiment, not reason:

**The Inertia of Reason:**
> "Reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them."

- Reason is "perfectly inert"—it cannot motivate action
- Passions, sentiments, and desires move us
- Reason discovers means to ends but cannot set ends
- "It is not contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger"

**Against Moral Rationalism:**
Hume challenges the tradition that gives reason preference in the "combat of passion and reason." Moral evaluations depend significantly on sentiment, not pure reason.

**The Role of Sympathy:**
- Sympathy is "a principle for the communication and sharing of sentiments, both positive and negative"
- More like modern "empathy"—partaking of others' feelings, beliefs, emotions
- Sympathy extends our natural sentiments beyond ourselves
- Sympathy-generated pleasure is the moral approbation we feel toward character traits

**Moral Approbation:**
- Approval (approbation) is a pleasure; disapproval (disapprobation) a pain
- Our moral sense responds specifically to "mental qualities" (character traits, dispositions)
- Actions are only virtuous derivatively, as signs of someone's mental dispositions

**Virtue Ethics Connection:**
Only settled character traits are sufficiently "durable" to determine our evaluations. Hence Hume's ethical theory is sometimes classified as a form of virtue ethics.

**Natural vs. Artificial Virtues:**
- **Natural Virtues:** Benevolence, meekness, charity, generosity—"produce pleasure and approbation by means of a natural sense"
- **Artificial Virtues:** Justice, keeping promises, allegiance, chastity—depend "for their existence as character traits and for their ethical merit on the presence of conventional rules for the common good"

**The Impartial Spectator:**
We approve of traits as viewed from a "steady and general point of view"—not merely those that benefit us personally, but those a disinterested observer would approve.

### Mitigated Skepticism

**Against Pyrrhonian Skepticism:**
Hume rejects extreme (Pyrrhonian) skepticism—"blanket attacks on all reasoning about the external world, abstract reasoning about space and time, or causal reasoning about matters of fact." Such skepticism produces no "durable good."

**Nature's Victory:**
> "Nature will always maintain her rights, and prevail in the end over any abstract reasoning whatsoever."

A Pyrrhonian tries to suspend all beliefs about the unobserved and resist custom, "but Nature is always too strong for principle."

**Mitigated Skepticism Defined:**
A moderate form of skepticism combining:
1. **From the Academics:** Intellectual integrity and moderation
2. **From the Pyrrhonians:** Limitation of inquiry to common life

Two core features:
1. Given the "evident weaknesses and limitations of human understanding," adopt "a degree of doubt, caution and modesty" with respect to beliefs
2. Limit enquiries "to such subjects as are best adapted to the narrow capacity of human understanding"

**The Return to Common Life:**
> "A correct judgment confines itself to common life, and to such subjects as fall under daily practice and experience; leaving the more sublime topics to the embellishment of poets and orators."

Philosophy is for the study; when we leave the study, we return to backgammon, dinner, and conversation. Skeptical doubt dissolves in practical engagement.

## Patterns

### The Impression Test
When any idea seems unclear or contentious:
1. Ask: "From what impression is this idea derived?"
2. If no impression can be found, suspect the idea is meaningless
3. Apply especially to metaphysical terms: substance, self, cause, necessity, power
4. If only a word remains without experiential content, reject it

### The Conceivability Test
For claims of necessity:
1. Ask: "Can I conceive the contrary?"
2. If the contrary is conceivable without contradiction, the matter is not demonstrable
3. It is a matter of fact, dependent on experience
4. Example: "The sun might not rise"—conceivable, therefore not necessary

### Proportioned Belief Assessment
For evaluating any evidential claim:
1. What is the evidence for this claim?
2. How uniform is the experience supporting it?
3. What is the evidence against or for alternatives?
4. What is the quality and reliability of testimony?
5. Proportion belief accordingly—stronger evidence, stronger belief; never certainty for matters of fact

### The Is-Ought Detector
When moral arguments are presented:
1. Identify all factual premises (descriptions of what is)
2. Identify the moral conclusion (prescriptions of what ought)
3. Look for hidden evaluative premises bridging the gap
4. If none exist, the argument has an unbridged logical gap
5. The gap may be bridgeable, but it requires an explicit evaluative premise

### Custom vs. Reason Analysis
For any inferential practice:
1. Can this inference be rationally justified without circularity?
2. If not, what psychological process produces the expectation?
3. Is it custom, imagination, habit, instinct, sympathy?
4. Distinguish what reason establishes from what nature compels us to believe
5. Recognizing custom's role does not invalidate the belief—it explains it

### Causation Examination
For any causal claim:
1. Do we observe contiguity (spatial/temporal connection)?
2. Do we observe priority (cause before effect)?
3. Do we observe constant conjunction (repeated pairing)?
4. Are we *projecting* necessity onto objects from our psychological habits?
5. Can we find alternative explanations (coincidence, confounding, reverse causation)?

## Gotchas

### Hume Is Not a Simple Skeptic
- He practices **mitigated** skepticism, not Pyrrhonian
- He explicitly says extreme skepticism is impractical and produces no good
- "Nature will always maintain her rights"
- The study is for skepticism; common life is for custom and belief

### The Treatise vs. Enquiries
- Hume himself preferred the Enquiries as better expressions of his views
- The *Treatise* is more systematic but messier and more ambitious
- "Never literary attempt was more unfortunate"—but scholars now mine it for depths the Enquiries lack
- Read both, but take Hume's preference seriously

### Is-Ought Is Not "You Can't Make Moral Claims"
- Hume is not saying morality is impossible or meaningless
- He grounds morality robustly in *sentiment*
- The is-ought problem concerns the *logic* of derivation, not the *existence* of values
- Hume was a moral philosopher, not a moral skeptic

### The Problem of Induction Is Not "Induction Doesn't Work"
- Induction obviously works in practice—we navigate the world successfully
- The problem is we cannot *rationally justify* why it works
- Hume accepts we must and do use induction
- Custom does the work reason cannot

### Hume's "Fork" Is Sometimes Misapplied
- Not all knowledge fits neatly into analytic/synthetic in the strong sense
- Modern philosophy of language complicates the dichotomy
- Quine's critique of the analytic-synthetic distinction is relevant
- Some propositions (natural kind terms, conceptual truths) resist easy classification

### Hume Was Famous as a Historian
- In his own time and for a century after, Hume was known primarily as a historian
- *The History of England* was the standard work until Macaulay
- His philosophical works were rediscovered later
- Don't reduce Hume to epistemology alone

### Hume's Religious Views Are Complex
- He was called "the Great Infidel" but also "Saint David" by friends
- He never explicitly declared atheism
- His critiques of religion work by skeptical questioning, not dogmatic denial
- The *Dialogues* give voice to multiple positions—Philo is closest to Hume but not identical

## Best Practices

### For Humean Analysis
1. Start with experience—what impressions are relevant?
2. Apply the copy principle to test abstract ideas
3. Use the conceivability test for claims of necessity
4. Proportion belief to evidence
5. Distinguish what reason establishes from what custom produces
6. Accept that much of what we believe is psychologically grounded, not rationally demonstrated

### For Philosophical Temperament
1. Maintain sociability—philosophy is not for hermits
2. Balance skepticism with practical engagement
3. Accept human nature rather than fighting it
4. Return to common life from the study
5. "Be a philosopher; but... be still a man"
6. Skepticism should produce modesty, not melancholy

### For Modern Applications
1. Apply the problem of induction to ML generalization claims
2. Use Hume's causation analysis for correlation vs. causation questions
3. Apply is-ought analysis to "data-driven" policy recommendations
4. Question claims of necessity in complex systems
5. Recognize the role of priors/assumptions as philosophical custom

## Influence and Reception

### Kant's Awakening
> "I freely confess that it was the remembrance of David Hume that first interrupted my dogmatic slumber."

Hume's critique of causation and induction prompted Kant's critical philosophy—the attempt to secure knowledge while acknowledging Humean limits. Kant conceived the entire *Critique of Pure Reason* as a response to "that Humean skeptical teaching."

### Logical Positivism and the Vienna Circle
The Vienna Circle manifesto traced their teachings back to Hume:
- Verification principle echoes the impression test
- Rejection of metaphysics as meaningless follows Hume's "sophistry and illusion"
- "Hume's Fork" (analytic/synthetic) became foundational
- Twentieth-century logical positivism "tests the limits of Empiricism" in a heavily Humean mode

### Contemporary Philosophy
- **Causation:** Remains a major topic; counterfactual, regularity, and process theories all respond to Hume
- **Problem of induction:** Spawned extensive debate; Popper, Goodman, Bayesianism all engage it
- **Ethics:** Projectivism and expressivism trace to Humean sentimentalism
- **Philosophy of mind:** Naturalism and the cognitive science paradigm find roots in Hume
- **Analytic philosophy:** Hume "probably had the greatest influence on contemporary analytic philosophy" among early modern philosophers

### The Scottish Enlightenment Legacy
Hume, along with Adam Smith and Francis Hutcheson, created the intellectual foundations of modern economics, moral psychology, and naturalistic philosophy. Their friendship shaped modern thought in ways we still feel.

## Famous Passages

### On Custom
> "Custom, then, is the great guide of human life. It is that principle alone which renders our experience useful to us, and makes us expect, for the future, a similar train of events with those which have appeared in the past."

### On Reason and Passion
> "Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them."

### On the Self
> "The identity, which we ascribe to the mind of man, is only a fictitious one, and of a like kind with that which we ascribe to vegetables and animal bodies."

### On Evidence
> "A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence."

### On Miracles
> "No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind, that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavours to establish."

### On Philosophy and Life
> "Be a philosopher; but, amidst all your philosophy, be still a man."

### On Metaphysics
> "If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion."

### On Necessity
> "Necessity is something that exists in the mind, not in objects."

### On Beauty
> "Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them."

### On Knowledge
> "All knowledge degenerates into probability."
