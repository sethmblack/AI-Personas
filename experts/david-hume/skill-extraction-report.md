## Skill Candidates Identified

### 1. Impression Tracing

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear process: identify idea, trace to impression, evaluate legitimacy |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Obvious triggers: "What does this term really mean?", "Is this idea grounded in experience?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Single responsibility: testing abstract ideas for empirical grounding |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any abstract concept, buzzword, or metaphysical claim |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Cuts through jargon, exposes empty concepts, clarifies discourse |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** A systematic method for testing whether an abstract idea has legitimate content by tracing it back to the sense impressions from which it derived. Identifies empty concepts that are "mere words without referent."

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What does this term actually mean?"
- "Is this concept grounded in experience?"
- "Trace this idea to its source"
- "What impression gives rise to this idea?"
- "Is this just jargon or does it mean something?"

### 2. Induction Audit

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear process: identify inference, examine leap, test uniformity assumption, assess risks |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Trigger: "Will this generalize?", "Is this pattern reliable?", "What are the limits of this inference?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on examining the gap between observed and unobserved |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any predictive claim, ML model, statistical inference, trend extrapolation |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Critical for AI/ML, statistics, forecasting, policy decisions based on data |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Systematic examination of any inference from observed data to unobserved cases. Identifies the uniformity assumptions being made, surfaces distributional shift risks, and forces acknowledgment of inductive limits.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Will this model generalize?"
- "Can we rely on this pattern continuing?"
- "What assumptions are we making about the future?"
- "What are the limits of this inference?"

### 3. Is-Ought Analysis

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear five-step process: identify factual premises, identify moral conclusion, find hidden premises, evaluate gap |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Trigger: "Is this a valid moral argument?", "Can we derive this ought?", "Check this reasoning" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused solely on detecting is-ought gaps in moral reasoning |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any moral argument, policy justification, ethical claim |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Essential for ethics review, policy analysis, detecting manipulative arguments |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Systematic detection of fallacious moral arguments that attempt to derive prescriptive conclusions (what ought to be) from purely descriptive premises (what is). Surfaces hidden evaluative premises and identifies unbridged logical gaps.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Is this a valid moral argument?"
- "Can we derive 'ought' from these facts?"
- "Is there an is-ought fallacy here?"
- "What hidden values are assumed?"
- "Apply Hume's guillotine"
- "Check this ethical reasoning"

### 4. Causation Examination

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear process: check contiguity, priority, constant conjunction; identify projected necessity; explore alternatives |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Trigger: "Is this really causation?", "Is this just correlation?", "Examine this causal claim" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on distinguishing genuine causation from correlation, habit, and projection |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any causal claim in science, statistics, AI, policy, everyday reasoning |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Critical for data analysis, scientific reasoning, avoiding spurious causal claims |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Systematic analysis of any causal claim to distinguish genuine causation from mere correlation, habitual association, or projected necessity. Applies Hume's criteria (contiguity, priority, constant conjunction) while acknowledging the psychological projection of necessity.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Is this causation or correlation?"
- "What evidence do we have for this cause?"
- "Are we projecting necessity?"
- "Examine this causal claim"
- "Is this a genuine causal relationship?"
- "What causes this effect?"

### 5. Mitigated Skepticism Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Framework clear: proportion doubt to evidence, limit inquiry to capacity, return to common life |
| Invocable | 9/10 | Trigger: "How confident should I be?", "Am I being too certain?", "Should I doubt this?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on applying appropriate levels of doubt without paralysis |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any belief, claim, or decision requiring calibrated confidence |
| Valuable | 9/10 | Promotes intellectual humility and practical wisdom |

**Total: 47/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Framework for applying proportioned skepticism—fierce enough to challenge dogma, gentle enough to preserve practical life. Calibrates doubt to evidence strength while maintaining actionability.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How confident should I be about this?"
- "Am I being appropriately skeptical?"
- "Should I doubt this or is that too extreme?"
- "Help me proportion my belief"
- "Is my certainty warranted?"

### 6. Proportioned Belief Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Clear process: evaluate evidence uniformity, assess testimony quality, proportion accordingly |
| Invocable | 9/10 | Trigger: "How much should I believe this?", "Is this evidence strong enough?" |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on calibrating belief strength to evidence—overlaps somewhat with mitigated skepticism |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any evidential claim |
| Valuable | 9/10 | Essential for rational decision-making |

**Total: 46/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** Systematic framework for calibrating the strength of belief to the strength of evidence. Applies the maxim "A wise man proportions his belief to the evidence" to any claim.

**Note:** Significant overlap with Mitigated Skepticism Assessment. Consider combining or subsuming under that skill.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "A wise man proportions belief to evidence"
- "How strong is this evidence?"
- "What should my confidence level be?"

## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority):**
1. `impression-tracing` - Testing ideas for empirical grounding
2. `induction-audit` - Examining inferential leaps and generalization limits
3. `is-ought-analysis` - Detecting fallacious moral arguments
4. `causation-examination` - Distinguishing causation from correlation
5. `mitigated-skepticism` - Applying proportioned doubt

**Phase 2 - Extended Skills (MEDIUM Priority):**
6. Consider `proportioned-belief` if distinct enough from mitigated-skepticism

**Not Recommended:**
- Bundle Theory Self-Analysis (too specialized, infrequent use)
- Miracle Testimony Evaluation (subsumed by other skills)

---

## Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Added to `experts/david-hume/PROMPT.md` in an "Available Skills" section
2. Triggered proactively when the Hume expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly

### Skill Interaction Notes

- **impression-tracing** + **is-ought-analysis**: Natural pairing when analyzing moral concepts—first trace the moral term to impressions, then check the argument structure
- **induction-audit** + **causation-examination**: Often combined when evaluating scientific or data-driven claims
- **mitigated-skepticism** + all others: Meta-skill that calibrates how to apply the others

### Key Implementation Principle

All Humean skills should maintain the **empiricist stance**—tracing claims to experience, proportioning belief to evidence, and acknowledging the role of custom where reason cannot fully justify. The output should be careful, measured analysis, not dogmatic pronouncement.
