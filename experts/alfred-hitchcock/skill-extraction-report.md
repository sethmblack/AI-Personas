## HIGH Priority

### 1. suspense-architecture

**Source Pattern:** Suspense vs. Surprise / The Bomb Under the Table
**Purpose:** Design information revelation to maximize audience tension through anticipation rather than shock.
**Trigger:** "How do I build suspense?" or "Should I reveal this now or later?" or "How do I keep them engaged?"
**Inputs:** The key information/reveal, the audience, the current structure, desired emotional effect
**Outputs:** Information revelation timeline, specific "bomb" identification, tension-building recommendations, payoff strategy
**Reasoning:** This is Hitchcock's most famous and universally applicable principle. The bomb-under-the-table framework provides clear, actionable guidance for any communication—presentations, narratives, product launches, negotiations. Transforms how people think about information timing.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear decision framework (reveal vs. withhold) with specific criteria
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases exist
- Scoped: YES - focused on information timing and revelation
- Reusable: YES - applies to presentations, stories, product design, communication
- Valuable: YES - transforms engagement by shifting from surprise to suspense mindset

**Score: 48/50**

### 2. visual-communication-audit

**Source Pattern:** Pure Cinema / Show Don't Tell
**Purpose:** Evaluate any communication to identify where visual demonstration could replace verbal explanation.
**Trigger:** "Am I showing or telling?" or "How can I make this more visual?" or "Pure cinema audit"
**Inputs:** Presentation, document, pitch, or narrative to evaluate
**Outputs:** Element-by-element assessment (visual vs. verbal), specific recommendations for visual alternatives, priority list for conversion
**Reasoning:** Hitchcock's silent film foundation gave him an instinct most communicators lack. This skill applies the "would it work as a silent film?" test to any medium. Highly practical for presentations, pitches, documentation, teaching.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific audit process with concrete outputs
- Invocable: YES - clear trigger phrases
- Scoped: YES - visual vs. verbal assessment
- Reusable: YES - presentations, documents, pitches, products
- Valuable: YES - addresses universal weakness in communication

**Score: 45/50**

### 3. macguffin-identification

**Source Pattern:** The MacGuffin
**Purpose:** Distinguish what characters/stakeholders care about from what the audience actually needs to care about, focusing effort accordingly.
**Trigger:** "What's the real point here?" or "Am I focused on the MacGuffin?" or "What actually matters to the audience?"
**Inputs:** Project, narrative, or situation with multiple elements competing for attention
**Outputs:** MacGuffin identification (necessary but emotionally irrelevant elements), true emotional stakes identification, recommendation for attention allocation
**Reasoning:** The MacGuffin principle prevents the common error of obsessing over plot/content details while neglecting emotional engagement. Applicable to product features (which are MacGuffins vs. which are core experience), presentations (what seems important vs. what audience cares about), and strategic planning.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear categorization process
- Invocable: YES - distinctive trigger phrases
- Scoped: YES - content vs. emotional relevance assessment
- Reusable: YES - products, presentations, narratives, strategy
- Valuable: YES - corrects widespread attention misallocation

**Score: 44/50**

### 4. villain-development

**Source Pattern:** "The more successful the villain, the more successful the picture"
**Purpose:** Strengthen any conflict, pitch, or narrative by investing in the opposition/obstacle/antagonist.
**Trigger:** "Is my villain strong enough?" or "Why doesn't this conflict feel compelling?" or "How do I make the stakes real?"
**Inputs:** Current antagonist/opposition/obstacle, protagonist situation, desired conflict intensity
**Outputs:** Villain assessment, specific strengthening recommendations, charm/competence/threat balance analysis
**Reasoning:** Hitchcock's insight that protagonists are only as interesting as their opposition applies far beyond film. Startups need compelling competitors/problems, presentations need worthy challenges, change initiatives need formidable status quo. This skill prevents the "weak enemy" problem.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - assessment criteria and strengthening recommendations
- Invocable: YES - clear triggers
- Scoped: YES - opposition/antagonist development
- Reusable: YES - pitches, narratives, strategy, change management
- Valuable: YES - addresses common weakness in conflict design

**Score: 42/50**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. audience-psychology-mapping

**Source Pattern:** "Play the audience like a piano" / Emotional architecture
**Purpose:** Map the intended emotional journey of an audience through any experience, identifying fear, desire, tension, and release points.
**Trigger:** "What should they feel and when?" or "Map the emotional journey" or "Hitchcock the experience"
**Inputs:** Experience, presentation, or narrative to analyze; target audience
**Outputs:** Emotion-by-segment map, tension/release diagram, fear and desire identification, recommendations for emotional intensification
**Reasoning:** Hitchcock's systematic approach to audience emotion—treating viewers as instruments to be played—provides a framework for experience design. Medium priority because it's broader and more abstract than the high-priority skills, requiring more judgment to apply.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - mapping process produces concrete output
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases
- Scoped: PARTIAL - broad scope (entire emotional journey)
- Reusable: YES - experiences, presentations, products, narratives
- Valuable: YES - elevates emotional intentionality

**Score: 38/50**

### 6. information-asymmetry-design

**Source Pattern:** Kuleshov Effect / Audience knowledge vs. character knowledge
**Purpose:** Design what different parties know at each stage of an interaction for maximum engagement and interpretation.
**Trigger:** "Who knows what when?" or "How do I structure information asymmetry?" or "Kuleshov this"
**Inputs:** Parties involved, information to be shared, desired interpretations
**Outputs:** Knowledge matrix (who knows what when), juxtaposition opportunities, interpretation predictions
**Reasoning:** The Kuleshov insight—that meaning emerges from juxtaposition and audience interpretation—applies to negotiation, teaching, product design, and communication. Medium priority due to sophistication required to apply well.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - matrix output with clear structure
- Invocable: YES - specific triggers
- Scoped: YES - information distribution design
- Reusable: YES - negotiation, teaching, product, narrative
- Valuable: YES - powerful but requires sophistication

**Score: 36/50**

### 7. frame-size-importance-audit

**Source Pattern:** Hitchcock's Rule (frame size = importance)
**Purpose:** Audit any visual communication to ensure element prominence matches actual importance.
**Trigger:** "Is this sized right?" or "What should be biggest?" or "Hitchcock Rule check"
**Inputs:** Visual communication (slide, page, interface, shot list)
**Outputs:** Element importance ranking, current size/prominence ranking, mismatches identified, recommendations
**Reasoning:** Simple but powerful principle that most presentations, documents, and interfaces violate. The poisoned milk should be large when it matters. Medium priority because it's a specific application of visual thinking rather than a full framework.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear audit process
- Invocable: YES - specific triggers
- Scoped: YES - visual element sizing
- Reusable: YES - slides, interfaces, documents, video
- Valuable: PARTIAL - valuable but narrow application

**Score: 34/50**
