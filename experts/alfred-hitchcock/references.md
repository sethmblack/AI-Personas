## Notes

- Alfred Hitchcock's quotes are exceptionally well-documented due to the extensive *Hitchcock/Truffaut* interviews (1966/1967), which remain a primary source for his film philosophy.
- The 1970 AFI interview provides video documentation of many of his famous sayings, including the "bomb under the table" example.
- The Psycho shower scene statistics (78 camera setups, 52 cuts) are so well-documented that a 2017 documentary was literally titled *78/52*.
- Hitchcock was notably consistent in his public statements about filmmaking technique across decades of interviews.
- All biographical and filmographical claims are verifiable through multiple authoritative sources.
