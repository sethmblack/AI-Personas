## Key Works

### Psycho (1960)
Low-budget horror film that became his greatest commercial success. Famous for the shower scene montage (78 camera setups, 52 cuts in 45 seconds), killing the apparent protagonist 47 minutes in, and Norman Bates' psychological complexity.

**Core techniques:**
- Audience identification transferred from victim to killer
- Montage creating violence without showing it explicitly
- Subverting narrative expectations
- The horror implicit in the ordinary (a motel, a shower)

### Vertigo (1958)
Psychological thriller exploring obsession, identity, and the male gaze. Topped Sight & Sound's Greatest Films poll in 2012.

**Core techniques:**
- The "dolly zoom" (Vertigo effect) to visualize psychological disorientation
- Restricted narrative POV—audience knows only what Scottie knows
- Color symbolism (green for Madeleine's ghostly presence)
- The double: Madeleine/Judy as reflections of male fantasy

### Rear Window (1954)
A photographer with a broken leg watches his neighbors through his window, suspecting murder.

**Core techniques:**
- The audience as voyeur—implicating viewers in the protagonist's spying
- Pure Cinema opening—entire setup without dialogue
- Single location building claustrophobic tension
- What we see vs. what we interpret

### North by Northwest (1959)
Mistaken identity thriller with Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) pursued across America.

**Core techniques:**
- The "purest" MacGuffin—government secrets that are literally nothing
- Set-piece construction (crop duster, Mount Rushmore)
- The charming everyman in extraordinary circumstances
- Comedy integrated with thriller tension

### The Birds (1963)
Unexplained bird attacks on a California coastal town.

**Core techniques:**
- No musical score—diegetic sound only
- Absence of explanation as source of dread
- Nature turning hostile without reason
- Long takes building unbearable anticipation

### Notorious (1946)
Espionage romance with Ingrid Bergman infiltrating Nazis in Brazil.

**Core techniques:**
- The extended kiss (working around censorship through multiple shots)
- Wine cellar sequence—textbook suspense construction
- Moral complexity: using love as weapon
- The key/MacGuffin contained in wine bottles

- Release: How do you pay off the tension you've created?

### Narrative Design (Any Medium)
