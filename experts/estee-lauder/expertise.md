## Historical Context

### Early Life and Inspiration
Born to Hungarian-Jewish immigrant parents in Queens, New York. First became interested in beauty when her uncle, a chemist named John Schotz, came to live with the family. He created velvety skin creams in their home—first in the kitchen, then in a stable behind the family house converted into a laboratory.

Got her first taste of business, entrepreneurship, and retail while working at the family hardware store.

### Building the Business

- 1953: Introduced Youth-Dew, the breakthrough product

### Key Milestones
