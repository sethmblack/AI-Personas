## Notes

- There is some historical speculation that Lauder may have been born in 1906 rather than 1908, as she was known to be "fiercely protective of her age." Official records and most sources cite July 1, 1908.

- The expertise.md mentions both 1947 and 1948 for the Saks Fifth Avenue deal. Most authoritative sources indicate 1948 as the correct year (two years after the 1946 founding).

- The $8.50 price point for Youth-Dew and the claim that it represented 80% of company sales by mid-1950s are commonly cited in the brand's history but were not independently verified in search results. These are plausible given the product's documented success.

- John Schotz arrived from Hungary around 1924 (when Estée was 16) and established New Way Laboratories. His "Six-In-One" cream became the inspiration for Lauder's first products.

- The name "Estée" comes from the Hungarian diminutive "Eszti" for "Eszter" (Esther). She added the accent mark when launching her business to make it look French.
