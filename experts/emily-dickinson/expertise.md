## Key Works

### The Poems (1,789 poems, mostly unpublished in her lifetime)

Dickinson wrote nearly 1,800 poems, of which only about 10 were published during her lifetime—and those anonymously, with editorial changes she did not approve. The vast body of her work was discovered after her death by her sister Lavinia in a locked chest, carefully bound into hand-sewn booklets called "fascicles."

**Major themes across her poetry:**
- Death and immortality
- Nature as revelation
- The soul and consciousness
- Pain, suffering, and despair
- Love and loss
- Identity and selfhood
- Faith and doubt
- The creative process

### The Letters

Dickinson was a prolific correspondent. Over 1,000 letters survive, addressed to nearly 100 recipients. Her letters often blur the line between prose and poetry, containing the same compression, startling imagery, and philosophical depth as her poems.

**Key correspondences:**
- **Thomas Wentworth Higginson** - Literary mentor and correspondent from 1862 until her death
- **Susan Gilbert Dickinson** - Sister-in-law and closest intimate; received over 300 letters
- **Judge Otis Lord** - Late-life romantic correspondence
- **Samuel Bowles** - Editor of the Springfield Republican

## Historical Context

### Amherst in Dickinson's Era
- Small New England town with strong Puritan heritage
- Home to Amherst College (founded 1821)
- Center of religious revivals and evangelical fervor
- High mortality rate, especially among young people
- Dickinson's family was prominent: grandfather founded Amherst College, father was a lawyer and U.S. Congressman

### The Dickinson Homestead
- Emily lived in the family home (The Homestead) nearly her entire life
- After returning from Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (1847-1848), she increasingly withdrew from society
- By her 40s, she rarely left the house and often communicated with visitors from behind doors
- Her bedroom became her creative sanctuary

### Literary Context
- Transcendentalism flourishing (Emerson, Thoreau)
- American Renaissance in literature
- Women's writing conventions (sentimental poetry, domestic themes)
- Dickinson rejected these conventions while appearing to inhabit them

### Timeline of Withdrawal

- 1850s: Active social life, but increasingly homebound
- 1858-1865: Most prolific writing period; over 1,000 poems
- 1862: Begins correspondence with Higginson
- 1864: Eye trouble; visits Boston for treatment (rare departure)
- 1870s-80s: Almost complete seclusion; wears only white
- 1886: Dies of Bright's disease at 55

## Famous Poems

### "Because I could not stop for Death" (479)
Death personified as a courteous gentleman caller who takes the speaker on a carriage ride through life's stages toward eternity. Transforms death from terror to gentle escort.

### "I felt a Funeral, in my Brain" (340)
Psychological breakdown rendered as funeral ceremony. The descent into madness or despair described through concrete funeral imagery.

### "Hope is the thing with feathers" (314)
Hope embodied as a bird that perches in the soul, singing endlessly without asking anything in return. Transforms abstract virtue into living creature.

### "I'm Nobody! Who are you?" (288)
Celebrates anonymity over fame. Being "somebody" is dreary, public, performative; being "nobody" is freedom.

### "A Bird came down the Walk" (359)
Precise observation of a bird's behavior reveals the strangeness of nature when truly seen. The ordinary made extraordinary through attention.

### "There's a certain Slant of light" (320)
Winter light as metaphor for oppression, spiritual weight, intimations of mortality. External phenomenon mirrors internal state.

### "The Soul selects her own Society" (409)
The soul's radical autonomy in choosing its companions—then closing the door forever.

### "After great pain, a formal feeling comes" (372)
The numbness following intense suffering, described through physical and ceremonial images.

### "I heard a Fly buzz — when I died" (591)
The moment of death interrupted by an ordinary fly. The mundane intrudes on the sublime.

### "Wild Nights — Wild Nights!" (269)
Passionate longing expressed through storm and sea imagery. Erotic intensity barely contained.

## Famous Quotes and Aphorisms

> "I dwell in Possibility —"

> "Forever — is composed of Nows —"

> "To live is so startling it leaves little time for anything else."

> "If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry."

> "I know nothing in the world that has as much power as a word."

> "The Soul should always stand ajar, ready to welcome the ecstatic experience."

> "Nature is a Haunted House — but Art — a House that tries to be haunted."

> "Find ecstasy in life; the mere sense of living is joy enough."

> "We turn not older with years, but newer every day."

## Philosophical Perspectives

### On Consciousness
> "The Brain — is wider than the Sky —
> For — put them side by side —
> The one the other will contain
> With ease — and You — beside —"

The inner world exceeds the outer world. Consciousness contains everything it perceives.

### On Death
Death is Dickinson's most frequent subject. Not morbid but investigative. She examines death from every angle: as gentleman caller, as physical process, as transition to immortality (questioned), as absolute ending (feared), as reunion (hoped).

### On Immortality
She neither affirms nor denies immortality with certainty. She holds the question open, examines it, turns it over.

### On Solitude
Dickinson's reclusion was not merely psychological retreat but creative choice. Solitude enabled perception.

### On Nature
Nature is not merely beautiful; it is strange, alien, meaningful. It requires interpretation.

### On Truth
Truth is powerful, dangerous, potentially blinding. It must be delivered carefully.

### On Pain
Suffering has formal properties. It can be examined, even if not explained.
