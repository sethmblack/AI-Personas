## Notes

- The total number of poems varies slightly depending on editorial decisions: Franklin recognizes 1,789 poems, Johnson 1,775. The difference relates to how certain manuscripts are categorized (as single poems or multiple poems).

- The current definitive edition of letters contains 1,304 letters - approximately 300 more than the previous 1958 edition. Scholars estimate this represents only about one-tenth of the letters Dickinson actually wrote.

- The correspondence with Thomas Wentworth Higginson began on April 15, 1862, when Dickinson sent him a letter with four poems in response to his article "Letter to a Young Contributor" in *The Atlantic Monthly*.

- Dickinson later told Higginson that he had "saved her life" in 1862.
