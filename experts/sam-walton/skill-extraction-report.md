## Detailed Analysis

### 1. competitive-intelligence-walk (HIGH)

**Source Methodology:**
Sam Walton visited competitors constantly—walking Kmart stores with a tape recorder, studying Sol Price's FedMart and Price Club, learning from Harry Cunningham. "I was in their stores constantly because they were the laboratory."

**Why It's a Skill:**
- **Actionable:** Clear protocol for visiting and analyzing competitors
- **Invocable:** "How do I learn from competitors?" / competitive analysis needed
- **Scoped:** Focused on observation methodology, not strategy
- **Reusable:** Works in any industry with competition
- **Valuable:** Systematic learning that most people do poorly

**Key Differentiator:** Focus only on what competitors do BETTER, not their weaknesses. Ego-free learning.

### 2. swim-upstream-analysis (HIGH)

**Source Methodology:**
"Ignore the conventional wisdom. If everybody else is doing it one way, there's a good chance you can find your niche by going in exactly the opposite direction." Small towns, rural distribution, discount pricing—all contrarian bets.

**Why It's a Skill:**
- **Actionable:** Framework for identifying and evaluating contrarian opportunities
- **Invocable:** "What's everyone else missing?" / strategic planning
- **Scoped:** Opportunity identification, not full strategy development
- **Reusable:** Any market, any industry
- **Valuable:** Systematic contrarian thinking vs. gut feel

---

### 3. sundown-rule (HIGH)

**Source Methodology:**
Answer every request by sundown. Respond to suppliers, customers, and associates the same day. Speed and responsiveness compound into trust.

**Why It's a Skill:**
- **Actionable:** Clear same-day response protocol
- **Invocable:** "How do I build trust through responsiveness?"
- **Scoped:** Focused on response discipline
- **Reusable:** Any business, any role
- **Valuable:** Differentiator in any service context

---

### 4. frontline-intelligence (HIGH)

**Source Methodology:**
"The folks on the front lines—the ones who actually talk to the customer—are the only ones who really know what's going on out there." MBWA, store visits, asking associates what's working and what's not.

**Why It's a Skill:**
- **Actionable:** Protocol for extracting insights from frontline workers
- **Invocable:** "What do my frontline people know that I don't?"
- **Scoped:** Information gathering, not management system
- **Reusable:** Any organization with customer-facing staff
- **Valuable:** Systematic vs. ad-hoc information flow

---

### 5. saturday-morning-meeting (MEDIUM)

**Why MEDIUM:**
- Actionable and proven, but format is organization-specific
- Requires ongoing commitment, not point-in-time use
- Better as reference material than standalone skill

---

### 6-9. (LOW Priority)

**Why LOW:**
- EDLP: Requires specific business model
- Hub-and-spoke: Physical distribution specific
- VPI contests: Retail merchandising specific
- Store-within-a-store: Org structure specific
