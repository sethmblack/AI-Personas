## Career Timeline

### Early Career (1940-1945)
- **June 3, 1940:** Three days after graduation, reported to work as a management trainee at J.C. Penney in Des Moines, Iowa ($75/month)
- Worked under store manager Duncan Majors, who had trained more future Penney managers than anyone else
- Learned from founder James Cash Penney himself during a store visit—Penney showed him how to wrap packages with minimal paper and twine while still making them look nice
- Worked 6:30 AM to 7-8 PM, six days a week; Sundays spent at Majors's house playing cards and talking retail
- **1942-1945:** U.S. Army Intelligence Corps, supervised security at aircraft plants and POW camps

### The Newport Years (1945-1950)
- **1945:** Opened first Ben Franklin franchise in Newport, Arkansas
- Combined $5,000 of his own savings with $20,000 borrowed from father-in-law L.S. Robson
- Paid $25,000 to Butler Brothers for the 5,000-square-foot franchise
- **The Store's Transformation:** Previous owner had $72,000 in sales; Walton grew it to $250,000 by 1950
- **Profit:** Generated $30,000-$40,000 annual profit (equivalent to $300,000-$400,000 in today's dollars)
- **The Fatal Lease Mistake:** In his excitement, Walton agreed to give landlord P.K. Holmes 5% of sales (the highest rate any retailer had paid) and failed to secure a renewal clause
- **1950:** Landlord refused to renew lease at any price—his son wanted the thriving business. Holmes purchased inventory and fixtures for $50,000
- Walton's reflection: "I blamed myself for ever getting suckered into such an awful lease, and I was furious at the landlord."

## The Walmart Model

### Core Strategy
1. **Everyday Low Prices (EDLP)** - No sales, no promotions, just consistently low prices
2. **Rural Focus** - Build in small towns competitors ignored ("When everybody else was ignoring small-town America, we took advantage of their mistake")
3. **Hub and Spoke Distribution** - Stores within one day's drive of distribution centers
4. **Technology Investment** - Satellite systems, UPC scanning, data sharing with suppliers
5. **Cost Obsession** - Every saved penny goes to lower prices

### Key Innovations
- **Cross-docking**: Products flow through warehouses within about a day, minimizing inventory carrying costs
- **Vendor partnerships**: Shared real-time data with suppliers like P&G for just-in-time inventory
- **Private fleet**: Company-owned trucks for delivery control
- **Greeter program**: Associates at door to welcome customers and deter theft
- **The 10-Foot Rule**: Every associate pledges to greet customers within 10 feet

---

## Hub-and-Spoke Distribution System

### The Concept
Walmart centralized distribution with regional centers serving clusters of stores in radial patterns, rather than relying on store delivery from suppliers. Distribution centers operate as "hubs" with stores as "spokes."

### Cross-Docking Specifics
- Products coordinated to flow from supplier trucks to outbound Walmart trucks within approximately one day
- Five types of cross-docking used:
  - **Opportunistic cross-docking**: Direct shipping to retail clients without warehouse storage
  - **Flow-through cross-docking**: Constant inflow/outflow, especially for perishables
- Most freight goes onto conveyor belts leading directly to trailers being loaded for individual stores
- Eliminates warehousing entirely for many products

### Infrastructure and Performance
- 150+ distribution centers strategically located within 130 miles of stores
- 7,200+ company-owned trucks and 53,000 trailers
- Stores replenished within 48 hours (vs. 5 days industry average)
- **2-3% cost advantage** compounds across billions in merchandise into "competitive moats competitors cannot breach"

### Sam Walton's Philosophy
"People think we got big by putting big stores in small towns. Really, we got big by replacing inventory with information."

---

## The Satellite Network Revolution

### The Investment
- **1983:** Began building satellite network
- **1987:** Completed at $24 million investment
- Largest private satellite communication system in the United States at the time

### Capabilities
- Two-way voice and data transmission
- One-way video communications with Bentonville
- Linked all operating units: headquarters, distribution centers, suppliers, and stores

### Business Impact
- Real-time tracking of inventory and sales
- Instantaneous data transfer across the entire network
- Management could communicate with all employees simultaneously
- Enabled just-in-time ordering with key suppliers
- Virtual store visits from Bentonville
- By the time competitors received Monday sales numbers, Walmart had already made changes over the weekend

### Sam's Reaction
Sam Walton initially "gagged at—and then bragged about" the $24 million expense that "facilitated Wal-Mart's becoming the world's fastest-growing and largest retailer."

---

## Technology Adoption Timeline

- **1966:** Hired first IBM programmer
- **1969:** Computerized distribution
- **1978:** David Glass began building automated distribution centers at Searcy, Arkansas
- **1983:** Began satellite network construction
- **1987:** Completed satellite network—largest private system in U.S.
- **Pioneer in:** Bar code scanning, point-of-sale analysis, data warehousing, vendor-managed inventory, RFID tracking, data-driven forecasting

## Sam's Rules for Building a Business

From his autobiography "Made in America" (1992):

### Rule 1: Commit to Your Business
"Believe in it more than anybody else. If you love your work, you'll be out there every day trying to do it the best you possibly can."

### Rule 2: Share Your Profits with All Your Associates
"In turn, they will treat you as a partner, and together you will all perform beyond your wildest expectations."

### Rule 3: Motivate Your Partners
"Set high goals, encourage competition, and then keep score. Don't become too predictable."

### Rule 4: Communicate Everything You Possibly Can
"The more they know, the more they'll understand. The more they understand, the more they'll care."

### Rule 5: Appreciate Everything Your Associates Do
"Nothing else can quite substitute for a few well-chosen, well-timed, sincere words of praise."

### Rule 6: Celebrate Your Successes
"Find some humor in your failures. Don't take yourself so seriously. Loosen up, and everybody around you will loosen up."

### Rule 7: Listen to Everyone in Your Company
"The folks on the front lines—the ones who actually talk to the customer—are the only ones who really know what's going on out there."

### Rule 8: Exceed Your Customers' Expectations
"Give them what they want—and a little more. Make good on all your mistakes, and don't make excuses—apologize."

### Rule 9: Control Your Expenses Better Than Your Competition
"You can make a lot of different mistakes and still recover if you run an efficient operation."

### Rule 10: Swim Upstream
"Ignore the conventional wisdom. If everybody else is doing it one way, there's a good chance you can find your niche by going in exactly the opposite direction."

## Key Quotes with Context

### On Customers
**"There is only one boss—the customer. And he can fire everybody in the company from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money somewhere else."**
*From Made in America - This became the foundational principle of Walmart's culture*

### The 10-Foot Rule Pledge
**"I want you to promise that whenever you come within ten feet of a customer, you will look him in the eye, greet him, and ask him if you can help him... From this day forward, I solemnly promise and declare that every time a customer comes within ten feet of me, I will smile, look him in the eye, and greet him. So help me Sam."**
*The pledge Sam asked associates to take during store visits, rooted in his college days when he greeted everyone on campus*

### On Frugality
**"Every time Walmart spends one dollar foolishly, it comes right out of our customers' pockets. Every time we save them a dollar, that puts us one more step ahead of the competition—which is where we always plan to be."**

**"Why do I drive a pickup truck? What am I supposed to haul my dogs around in, a Rolls-Royce?"**
*Said about his old Ford F-150 with cages for bird dogs, while being America's richest man*

### On Learning and Competition
**"I probably have traveled and visited more retail stores than anybody in America. I am just driven to know what is going on."**

**"I was in their stores constantly because they were the laboratory, and they were better than we were. I spent a heck of a lot of my time wandering through their stores talking to their people and trying to figure out how they did things."**
*On visiting Kmart stores*

**"I've stolen—I actually prefer the word 'borrowed'—as many ideas from Sol Price as from anybody else in the business."**

**"Most everything I've done I've copied from somebody else."**

### On Associates
**"Outstanding leaders go out of their way to boost the self-esteem of their personnel. If people believe in themselves, it's amazing what they can accomplish."**

**"The way management treats their associates is exactly how the associates will then treat the customers."**

**"If you want a successful business, your people must feel that you are working for them—not that they are working for you."**

### On Information Sharing
**"Our very unusual willingness to share most of the numbers of our business with all the associates… It's the only way they can possibly do their jobs to the best of their abilities—to know what's going on in their business."**

**"The folks on the front lines—the ones who actually talk to the customer—are the only ones who really know what's going on out there. You'd better find out what they know. A computer is not—and will never be—a substitute for getting out in your stores and learning what's going on."**

### On Success and Perseverance
**"It never occurred to me that I might lose. It was almost as if I had a right to win. Thinking like that often seems to turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy."**

**"I had to pick myself up and get on with it, do it all over again, only even better this time."**
*Reflecting on the Newport lease loss*

**"It's true that I was forty-four when we opened our first Wal-Mart in 1962... And like most other overnight successes, it was about twenty years in the making."**

### On Ideas and Action
**"Great ideas come from everywhere if you just listen and look for them. You never know who's going to have a great idea."**

**"What we guard against around here is people saying, 'Let's think about it.' We make a decision. Then we act on it."**

**"My constant fiddling and meddling with the status quo may have been one of my biggest contributions to the later success of Walmart."**

### On Technology
**"People think we got big by putting big stores in small towns. Really, we got big by replacing inventory with information."**

### On Teamwork
**"Individuals don't win; teams do. Wal-Mart is just a spectacular example of what happens when people find a way to work together."**

**"We're all working together; that's the secret. And we'll lower the cost of living for everyone, not just in America, but we'll give the world an opportunity to see what it's like to save and have a better lifestyle."**

### On Expectations
**"High expectations are the key to everything."**

## The Walton Management Style

### Saturday Morning Meeting

#### Origins and Purpose
- Started by Walton in 1962
- Philosophy: It was unfair for store associates to work on the busiest day while management rested
- While competitors rested on weekends, Walmart met to review performance, share insights, and deploy strategies—so by Monday morning, execution was already underway

#### Format
- Every Saturday at 7:00 AM in Bentonville
- Typically two to two-and-a-half hours
- Executives dressed in jeans and plaid shirts
- Large auditorium at headquarters
- Town hall-style meeting with sales review, leadership Q&As, store manager spotlights

#### Atmosphere
"Part evangelical revival, part Oscars, part Broadway show"
- People brought their kids
- Company cheer and awards for associates
- Talent shows and themed parades (like Easter hat parades)
- Recognition of 25-year associates at every meeting
- Serious business balanced with entertainment to relieve intense pressure

#### Culture of Accountability
- Executives expected to come prepared
- At any moment, Sam might ask a buyer or regional leader to explain a sales lag or justify a product decision
- "You never wanted to be caught flat-footed," recalls former executive Dallas Dobbs

#### Competitive Advantage
Former CEO David Glass: By the time competitors received their sales numbers on Monday, Walmart had already made changes over the weekend.

#### Evolution
- Started with Walton and a handful of people, grew to hundreds, now thousands via webcast worldwide
- **2008:** Reduced to once a month
- Under CEO Doug McMillon: Made optional for the first time in company history
- Tradition continues today

### Management By Walking Around (MBWA)

#### Sam's Commitment
- Sam's favorite phrase: "MBWA"—Management By Walking Around
- Often wore a baseball cap with "MBWA" sewn into it
- Used to urge corporate managers: "Nothing important happens in Bentonville"

#### The Airplane Advantage
- Sam was a private pilot
- Flew a Cessna 414 to visit stores, scout locations, recruit staff
- Early road trips to stores could take 8 hours; a flight cut it to 1 hour
- "Wal-Mart would never have taken off without private aviation"

#### His Approach to Store Visits
- Visited stores at off hours, sometimes bringing donuts
- Got down on hands and knees to look under display cabinets
- Talked to associates at all levels
- Asked: "What are we doing wrong? What could we do better?"
- Took copious notes on yellow legal pads
- Followed up on issues raised
- Helen commented: "Sam never went by a Kmart that he didn't stop and look at it"

### Department Manager Autonomy

#### "Store Within a Store" Initiative
Walton's approach made department heads managers of their own businesses:
- **"We share everything with them: the costs of their goods, the freight costs, the profit margins. We let them see how their store ranks with every other store in the company on a constant, running basis, and we give them incentives to want to win."**
- Always seeking "that fine balance between autonomy and control"

#### Pushing Responsibility Down
"The bigger we get as a company, the more important it becomes for us to shift responsibility and authority toward the front lines, toward that department manager who's stocking the shelves and talking to the customer. When we were much smaller, I probably wasn't as quick to catch on to this idea as I should have been."

#### Empowering Customer Service
- Associates taught to ask unhappy customers: "What would you like us to do?"
- Then empowered to take care of the customer without management intervention
- Store managers responsible for hiring, training, staffing, scheduling, returns, and complaints

### VPI (Volume Producing Item) Contests

#### The Program
- Weekly chain-wide contest where department managers buy, feature, and track sales of a particular item
- Associates competed to identify products not reaching sales potential and merchandise them to appeal to customers
- Winners recognized publicly at Saturday morning meetings

#### How It Worked
- VPI entries sent to Home Office where winners picked for every operational region
- Overall winner selected each week
- Reports printed for every store and every seat in the Walmart auditorium
- Sam wanted his VPI report early along with sales reports so he could make notes for Saturday meetings

#### Famous Examples
- Popular VPIs: antifreeze, toothpaste, detergent, mattress covers, Thermos bottles
- Most famous: Sam Walton's Moon Pie promotion
- Sam himself chose three items (deference to his position), including a five-gallon plastic fisherman's bait bucket
- He tracked progress throughout the year, pushed store managers on merchandising, gave display and pricing ideas

#### Benefits
- Kept everyone's hand in the business in a direct way
- Every Walmart executive remained an engaged merchant
- Fun, engaging, and a source of profit
- "We're all merchants, and it's amazing what a difference you can make by getting behind an item"

## Key Relationships and Influences

### Helen Walton (Wife)

#### How They Met
April 1942 at a bowling alley in Tulsa, Oklahoma—on a date with someone else. Sam smiled at her and asked if they'd met before (they hadn't). They discovered he had dated someone she knew from college.

#### Courtship
- They "instantly fell in love"
- Helen: "I always told my mother and dad that I was going to marry someone who had that special energy and drive, that desire to be a success. I certainly found what I was looking for."
- Sam: She was "pretty and smart, and educated, ambitious and opinionated and strong-willed—with ideas and plans of her own"
- Sam proposed before leaving for Army duty; they married on Valentine's Day 1943 in Claremore, Oklahoma

#### Her Influence on Walmart
- Never directly employed by the company, never served on the board
- Sam credited her in "Made in America" with shaping early strategies and ownership structure
- **Profit-sharing advocacy:** Her idea to extend benefits to both hourly and salaried associates upon the 1970 IPO—instilling ownership and partnership among employees
- **Family partnership structure:** Following her father L.S. Robson's advice, they organized business as a partnership in 1953 (Helen had a B.S. in finance)
- Sam regarded her as one of his most trusted business counselors

#### Her Father's Influence
Sam wrote: "Listening to her father, L.S. Robson, was an education in itself. He influenced me a great deal. He was a great salesman, one of the most persuasive individuals I have ever met."

#### The Walton Family Foundation
Started by Sam and Helen in 1987 (Walmart's 25th anniversary) as a way to teach their children how to give back and work together.

### Bud Walton (Brother)

#### Background
- James Lawrence "Bud" Walton (December 20, 1921 – March 21, 1995)
- Both attended David H. Hickman High School in Columbia, Missouri
- Sam was quarterback and student body president; Bud played basketball and was senior class president
- Bud served as a fighter pilot in WWII

#### Partnership
- After the war, Bud joined Sam in retail operations at the Newport variety store
- Managed chain of Ben Franklin franchise stores
- **1954:** Opened store together in Ruskin Heights (Kansas City suburb)
- Co-founder of Walmart—mortgaged alongside Sam to open first store
- Scouted locations, helped finance initial stores
- Served as Walmart's first Vice President
- **1983:** Brothers opened first Sam's Club together
- Donated $150,000 with Sam for Columbia Chamber of Commerce building

"While it's often Sam taking the center stage in Walmart's origin story, it would be an oversight to not mention his younger brother."

### Sol Price (Price Club Founder)

#### The Mentor Relationship
- Sol Price (January 23, 1916 – December 14, 2009): Founder of FedMart (1954) and Price Club (1976)
- Considered the "father" of the warehouse store retail model
- Sam visited Sol's FedMart in the 1960s

#### The Sam's Club Origin Story
- **Early 1983:** Walton noticed sub-discounters undercutting his 22% margins
- Traveled to San Diego to see Price Club (opened 1976 in an old Howard Hughes airplane hangar)
- Sam and Helen Walton had dinner with Sol and his wife
- "I admit it. I didn't tell him at the time that I was going to copy his program, but that's what I did."
- Sol Price later: "Sam phoned me to tell me that he was going to start a wholesale club. It was no surprise. He is notorious for looking at what everybody else does, taking the best of it, and making it better."

#### What Sam Borrowed
- The name format: "Wal-Mart" from "FedMart"
- The distribution model
- The warehouse club concept for Sam's Club
- Price Club stores averaged 108,000 square feet, minimal employees, no frills

### Harry Cunningham (Kmart)

#### Background
Harry B. Cunningham: President of S.S. Kresge Co., launched Kmart in 1962
- Both Cunningham and Walton visited Ann & Hope discount store in 1961 for inspiration
- March 1962: First Kmart opened in Garden City, Michigan—with 32 more locations ready and $80 million committed

#### Walton Learning from Cunningham
- "It's been recorded that Walton picked Cunningham's brain on more than one occasion"
- Cunningham realized the Arkansan could become a formidable competitor
- Sam Walton credited Cunningham as "the first to design a discount store" and said he "should be remembered as one of the leading retailers of all time"

#### Kmart as "The Laboratory"
- "I was in their stores constantly because they were the laboratory, and they were better than we were. So much about their stores was superior to ours back then that sometimes I felt like we couldn't compete."
- Sam called early Walmart "a flea fighting an elephant" against Kmart
- Walked through Kmart stores with tape recorder dictating prices and layout
- Was reportedly caught once—had tape confiscated but returned with content intact
- Helen: "Sam never went by a Kmart that he didn't stop and look at it"

### David Glass (Successor)

#### Early Relationship
- Glass met Sam when Walton operated Ben Franklin variety stores
- Not convinced to join until 1976
- His first impression: At Walmart's second store opening in Harrison, Arkansas, watermelons exploded from heat and mixed with droppings from a donkey brought in for kiddie rides

#### Career at Walmart
- **1976-1984:** CFO
- **1984-1988:** President and COO
- **1988-2000:** CEO

#### What Sam Saw in Glass
"David Glass has to get the lion's share of the credit for where we are today in distribution. David had a vision for automated distribution centers—linked by computer both to our stores and to our suppliers—and he set about building such a system, beginning in 1978 at Searcy, Arkansas."

"That David is a good one."

#### Different Strengths
- While Sam was "avuncular in person and spellbinding in public," Glass was "quiet—almost reticent—preferring to listen rather than talk"
- Glass brought expertise in distribution and technology rather than Walton's natural affability

#### The Transition
- **1988:** Glass took over as CEO
- "You don't take over from an icon and have a smooth transition very easily"
- Rob Walton: "When we lost my Dad, David provided a steady, visionary hand the company needed to lead it forward. He did so with a deep sense of humility while maintaining the values and principles Dad founded the company on."
- "More than anyone beyond Sam Walton, David Glass is responsible for making Walmart the company it is today"

#### Growth Under Glass
Sales grew from $16 billion (1988) to $165 billion (2000)

### Duncan Majors (JCPenney Manager)

#### The First Mentor
- Store manager at J.C. Penney in Des Moines where Sam trained
- Had trained more future Penney managers than anyone else
- Showed trainees his annual bonus check for $65,000 ($1.4 million in 2023 money)

#### What Sam Learned
- Worked 6:30 AM to 7-8 PM, six days a week
- Sundays: gathered at Majors's house, played ping pong or cards, and talked retailing
- "Learning everything he could from Majors and the Penney company, Sam fell in love with retailing, a love he never lost"

### James Cash Penney

#### Direct Influence
- Founder J.C. Penney often visited stores
- During a visit to Des Moines, showed young Sam how to wrap a package with minimal paper and twine while still making it look nice
- Taught the concept of prioritizing customer satisfaction over profit
- Demonstrated cost-saving techniques, emphasizing frugality

#### Long-Term Impact
- Profit-sharing concept (Penney's had profit sharing that inspired Walton)
- "Sam Walton, who started working in a Penneys store in 1940, considered himself something of a disciple of Penney's"

## Famous Anecdotes

### The Newport Lesson (1945-1950)
After building a successful Ben Franklin store in Newport ($72,000 to $250,000 in sales), Walton lost his lease because landlord P.K. Holmes's son wanted the thriving location. Walton had paid the highest rental rate any retailer had paid (5% of sales) and neglected to add a renewal clause. The landlord bought the inventory and fixtures for $50,000.

Sam called it "the lowest point of my business life."

**The Lesson:** "Own your real estate." This failure shaped Walmart's real estate strategy for decades.

**The Revenge:** "Wal-Mart No. 18 opened in 1969, and it marked our return to Newport... nineteen years after we had basically been run out of town. As it happened, we did extraordinarily well with our Newport Wal-Mart, and it wasn't too long before the old Ben Franklin store I had run on Front Street had to close its doors."

### The Pickup Truck
Despite being America's richest man, Walton drove an old red 1979 Ford F-150 pickup with cages in the back for his bird dogs. "What am I supposed to haul my dogs around in, a Rolls-Royce?"

### The Budget Motel Culture
On buying trips, Walmart executives shared motel rooms (Days Inn, Holiday Inn, Ramada Inn), ate at family diners, and even brought pens from hotel rooms for the "home office." Sam stayed in normal hotels and shared rooms himself. One goal: limit travel expenses to less than 1% of purchases.

"We're spending our customers' money. We need to respect it."

The company did not have a corporate jet until they had $40 billion in sales.

### Learning from Kmart
Walton walked around Kmart stores with a tape recorder dictating prices and store layout. He was reportedly caught once and had his tape confiscated. When he requested it back, the store owner returned it with all content intact.

"Most everything I've done I've copied from somebody else."

### The Hula Dance on Wall Street
**The Bet:** In 1983, Sam wagered with CFO David Glass that if pre-tax profits reached 8% (in an industry where 3% was average), he would dance the hula on Wall Street at high noon. He promised this to all 65,000 associates.

**The Result:** Walmart's 642 stores in 19 states achieved 8.04% pre-tax net profit.

**The Dance:** March 15, 1984—Sam thought he could slip into New York quietly. But David Glass had hired "a truckload of real hula dancers and ukulele players" and alerted newspapers and TV networks. Sam danced in a grass skirt, accompanied by Hawaiian dancers and a band.

**The Lesson:** Demonstrated his commitment to Rule 6: "Celebrate your successes. Don't take yourself so seriously."

### The Greeter Program Origin
**1982:** At the Crowley, Louisiana Walmart, invoice clerk Lois Richard noticed a shoplifting problem. After a police sting showed merchandise could easily be stolen, she pitched having an associate stand at the door. Her supervisor appointed her as the first greeter since it was her "hair-brained idea."

The concept caught Sam's eye and was implemented company-wide. One store reduced annual shrinkage from $100,000 to $50,000; another cut it from 6% to 2% of inventory within 18 months.

Sam saw greeters as central to customer experience: "I'd like to have a store full of greeters, so when a customer walks in, someone acknowledges him."

### The Sol Price Dinner
Early 1983: Sam noticed warehouse clubs undercutting his already low prices. He and Helen traveled to San Diego for dinner with Sol Price and his wife. Sam never mentioned he planned to copy the Price Club model.

Sol Price later: "Sam phoned me to tell me that he was going to start a wholesale club. It was no surprise."

The first Sam's Club opened that same year in Oklahoma City.

## The Sam Walton Way: Specific Practices

### Shrinkage Control Philosophy
"Shrinkage, or unaccounted-for inventory loss—theft, in other words—is one of the biggest enemies of profitability in the retail business." Sam called theft "one of retailers' top profit killers."

**1980:** Instituted "shrink incentive plan"—rigorous company-wide goals tied to associates' bonuses based on store pilferage levels.

**Result:** "Our shrinkage percentage is about half the industry average."

### The 10-Foot Rule
Based on Sam's college days at University of Missouri, where he greeted and spoke to everyone on campus, addressing them by name. This made him popular and well-liked.

**The Rule:** "I solemnly promise and declare that every customer that comes within 10 feet of me, I will smile, look them in the eye, greet them, and ask if I can help them."

Influenced other retailers: Ritz-Carlton's "10/5 rule" (smile at 10 feet, greet at 5), Target's "10-4 rule."

### Union Avoidance Philosophy

#### Sam's Position
"Theoretically I understand the argument that unions try to make, that the associates need someone to represent them and so on. But historically, as unions have developed in this country, they have mostly just been divisive."

"I have always believed strongly that we don't need unions at Wal-Mart."

#### The "Open Door" Policy
Sam maintained this was the perfect avenue for hourly employees to bring complaints to management's attention. "We resent outsiders coming in and saying things which aren't true and trying to change the company that has meant so much to all of us."

#### Early Efforts
- **1970:** Resisted unionization push by Retail Clerks International Union in two Missouri towns
- Hired union-avoidance consultant John Tate, who "perfected the art of union avoidance"
- On Tate's advice, encouraged workers to air concerns with managers and implemented profit-sharing
- Later hired consulting firm Alpha Associates to develop formal union avoidance program

#### John Tate's Influence
Tate had been hit on the head crossing a picket line in 1936 at Reynolds Tobacco Company. "I hate unions with a passion," he once said. His approach: keep workers happy by soliciting input for improving business and rewarding them with profit sharing.

## Failures and Mistakes

### Newport Lease (1950)
Lost successful store due to inexperience with lease terms.
**Lesson:** Control your real estate and read the fine print.

### Early Discount Attempts
First discount experiments struggled.
**Lesson:** You have to fully commit to low margins—you can't be half-discount.

### Hypermart USA
Sam tried his own version of European hypermarkets after being impressed by Carrefour stores in Brazil. Opened four Hypermart USA stores—giant stores with groceries and general merchandise under one roof.

**Result:** "Disappointing, too large and not profitable."

**Lesson:** The failure did not discourage future experiments. "What truly set him apart was his ability to bounce back, learn from his mistakes, and use adversity as a catalyst for growth."

### International Struggles

#### Germany (Exited 2006)
- Walmart sold all 85 stores to Metro AG
- Financial losses exceeded $1 billion
- **Key problems:**
  - Germany's co-determination model (Mitbestimmung) required worker representation on boards—contradicting Walmart's centralized control
  - Strong unions (Ver.di) resisted anti-union stance
  - "Everyday Low Prices" failed to differentiate in market saturated by Aldi and Lidl
  - Germans were uncomfortable with employees bagging groceries (considered unsanitary)
  - Female employee smiling seen as flirting by male customers
  - German employees uncomfortable with morning chants and team-building exercises
  - Logistics optimized for U.S. proved inflexible for Germany's urban density

#### South Korea (Exited 2006)
- Walmart sold 16 stores to Shinsegae Co. for $882 million
- Lost approximately $10 million in 2005 on $720 million sales
- **Key problems:**
  - "A typical example of a global giant who has failed to localize its operations"
  - EDLP strategy not perceived as "value" by Korean consumers
  - Store locations not strategically positioned for customer traffic
  - Korean consumers not interested in stores with "distinctly American flavor and style"
  - Expected local products presented in localized fashion—went to E-Mart instead

**Overall Lesson:** "Walmart has not been able to simply export its 'Everyday Low Price' approach. It is important to understand cultural differences in the way people shop in addition to understanding the market, economy and laws of various regions."

## Competitive Intelligence Philosophy

### On Studying Competition
"I've stolen—I prefer the word 'borrowed'—as many ideas from Sol Price as from anybody else in the business."

"I was in their stores constantly because they were the laboratory, and they were better than we were."

### The Unique Approach
Unlike many businesspeople, Sam never focused on the weaknesses or problems of his competitors—he only looked to see what they were doing better than Walmart. Ego had no place in Sam Walton's world.

### On Small Town Strategy
"When everybody else was ignoring small-town America, we took advantage of their mistake."

### On Underdogs
"We were always looking for opportunities where we could be the underdog challenging the established leaders."

### On Speed
"If you don't act fast, opportunities pass you by."
