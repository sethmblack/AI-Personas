## Notes and Clarifications

### Minor Discrepancies Identified

1. **Newport Store Sales Growth:** The expertise.md states "$72,000 to $250,000" but some sources cite "$80,000 to $225,000." Both ranges are used in various reputable sources. **Recommendation:** Keep as is; the general magnitude is accurate.

2. **1967 Revenue:** The expertise.md states "$12.6 million" while official Walmart sources cite "$12.7 million." **Recommendation:** Consider updating to $12.7M to match official records.

3. **Pickup Truck Year:** The expertise.md states "1985 Ford F-150" but all sources confirm it was a **1979 Ford F-150** purchased new. **Recommendation:** Correct to "1979 Ford F-150."

4. **$1 Billion Milestone Year:** Some sources cite 1979, others 1980. This is due to fiscal year vs. calendar year reporting. **Recommendation:** Keep "1979" as this is the commonly cited year.

### Claims That Could Not Be Precisely Verified

1. **CAGR percentages (40.1% for 1970s, 32.4% for 1980s):** While the general high-growth pattern is well documented, these exact percentages could not be independently verified. The figures appear reasonable based on reported revenues.

2. **Specific bonus/profit sharing figures from 2009 and 2024:** These are recent figures that appear to be from Walmart corporate communications but were not independently verified in this search.
