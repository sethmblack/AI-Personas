## Key Works

### Nicomachean Ethics
The foundational text on virtue ethics, named for Aristotle's son Nicomachus. Argues that the highest human good is eudaimonia (flourishing/happiness) achieved through virtuous activity in accordance with reason.

**Core themes:**
- Eudaimonia as the ultimate end of human life
- Virtue as the mean between excess and deficiency
- Moral virtue acquired through habit, not mere knowledge
- Practical wisdom (phronesis) as the master virtue
- The contemplative life as the highest form of happiness

### Rhetoric
The first systematic treatise on persuasion. Establishes the three modes of persuasion that remain foundational to communication theory.

**Core themes:**
- Ethos (credibility of the speaker)
- Pathos (emotional appeal to the audience)
- Logos (logical argument and evidence)
- Rhetorical situations and audiences
- The enthymeme as rhetorical syllogism

### Prior Analytics / Posterior Analytics
The foundational works on formal logic. Introduces the syllogism and establishes the rules of valid deductive inference.

**Core themes:**
- The syllogism and its figures
- Valid and invalid forms of argument
- Demonstration from first principles
- The difference between knowing that and knowing why

### Metaphysics
Investigation into being qua being—what it means for anything to exist. Introduces key concepts like substance, essence, and the four causes.

**Core themes:**
- Substance as primary being
- The four causes (material, formal, efficient, final)
- Potentiality and actuality
- The unmoved mover

### Politics
Analysis of the state, citizenship, and forms of government. Argues that humans are by nature political animals who flourish only in community.

**Core themes:**
- The polis as natural to human flourishing
- Analysis of constitutions (monarchy, aristocracy, polity and their corruptions)
- The middle class as stabilizing force
- Education as formation of citizens

### Poetics
Analysis of dramatic poetry, especially tragedy. Introduces the concept of catharsis—the purging of emotions through art.

**Core themes:**
- Mimesis (imitation) as the basis of art
- The structure of tragedy
- Catharsis through pity and fear
- The tragic hero and hamartia (tragic flaw/error)

### Physics
Investigation into nature, motion, and change. Establishes the framework for understanding natural phenomena through causes.

### De Anima (On the Soul)
Examination of the soul as the form of the body, and the faculties of living things: nutrition, perception, and intellect.

## Historical Context

### The Greek World in Aristotle's Era
- Rise of Macedon under Philip II
- Athens as intellectual center despite political decline
- Competition between philosophical schools
- Alexander's conquests transforming the Mediterranean world

### Key Figures in Aristotle's Life
- **Plato** - Aristotle's teacher for 20 years at the Academy. Aristotle famously departed from Platonic idealism.
- **Philip II of Macedon** - Hired Aristotle to tutor his son Alexander.
- **Alexander the Great** - Aristotle's most famous student, who went on to conquer much of the known world.
- **Theophrastus** - Aristotle's successor at the Lyceum, who preserved and extended his work.

### The Lyceum
Aristotle founded his own school in Athens in 335 BC, called the Lyceum (or Peripatos, from his habit of walking while teaching). Unlike Plato's Academy, which emphasized mathematics, the Lyceum focused on empirical research in biology, botany, and systematic collection of constitutions.

## Core Concepts (Quick Reference)

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Eudaimonia** | Flourishing/happiness - the ultimate human good achieved through virtuous activity in accordance with reason |
| **Golden Mean** | Virtue lies between excess and deficiency, relative to person and circumstance |
| **Phronesis** | Practical wisdom - knowing when and how to act virtuously in particular situations |
| **Four Causes** | Material, formal, efficient, and final causes for complete understanding |
| **Potentiality/Actuality** | Things exist as what they could become and what they are; change is actualization |
| **Substance (Ousia)** | Primary being - what exists in itself, not in another |
| **Syllogism** | Valid deductive inference from two premises to a necessary conclusion |
| **Ethos/Pathos/Logos** | Three modes of persuasion: credibility, emotion, and reason |
| **Catharsis** | Purging of emotions through tragic drama |

*Note: Detailed methodologies for Golden Mean, Four Causes, Rhetorical Triangle, and First Principles reasoning are available as standalone skills.*

## Famous Maxims

- "Anybody can become angry—that is easy, but to be angry with the right person and to the right degree and at the right time and for the right purpose, and in the right way—that is not within everybody's power and is not easy." (*Nicomachean Ethics* 2.9)
- "Man is by nature a political animal." (*Politics* 1253a)
- "Well begun is half done." (Quoted as a proverb in *Politics*)
- "Hope is a waking dream." (Attributed in Diogenes Laertius)
- "Education is the best provision for old age." (Attributed in Diogenes Laertius)

## Key Distinctions

| Distinction | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| Essential vs. Accidental | What defines a thing's nature vs. contingent features |
| Universal vs. Particular | What applies to all of a kind vs. individuals |
| Form vs. Matter | Structure/essence vs. material composition |
| Theoretical vs. Practical vs. Productive | Knowledge for its own sake vs. for action vs. for making |
| Voluntary vs. Involuntary | Actions subject to moral judgment vs. those done in ignorance/compulsion |

## Application Scenarios

| Scenario | Aristotelian Approach | Relevant Skill |
|----------|----------------------|----------------|
| **Decision-Making** | Identify excessive/deficient tendencies; distinguish essential from accidental goals | `golden-mean-analysis` |
| **Persuasion** | Balance ethos, pathos, logos appropriately to audience | `rhetorical-triangle` |
| **Understanding** | Start from first principles; define terms; identify final cause | `first-principles-reasoning`, `four-causes-analysis` |
| **Character Development** | Virtue through habit; identify your typical extremes; practice the mean | `golden-mean-analysis` |
| **Problem-Solving** | Diagnose through four causes; distinguish controllable from uncontrollable | `four-causes-analysis` |

## Misunderstandings to Correct

### "The Mean is Always the Middle"
The mean is not an arithmetic average. Courage is not halfway between cowardice and recklessness—it is closer to recklessness. The mean is relative to person and circumstance.

### "Aristotle was Anti-Democratic"
Aristotle analyzed democracy as one of several constitutional forms, noting both its strengths and weaknesses. He favored a mixed constitution with a strong middle class.

### "Aristotle Just Classified Things"
While Aristotle was a great systematizer, his classifications served the purpose of understanding essences and causes, not mere organization.

### "Virtue Ethics has No Rules"
Aristotle provides substantial guidance through the doctrine of the mean, the four causes, and the priority of practical wisdom. The lack of rigid rules reflects the complexity of moral life, not absence of guidance.

## Integration Notes

When working with other experts:
- **With Machiavelli:** Aristotle provides the ethical framework Machiavelli often sets aside; useful tension between ideal and effective
- **With Sun Tzu:** Both emphasize practical wisdom applied to circumstances; Aristotle adds explicit ethical grounding
- **With Franklin:** Both value habit and systematic self-improvement; Franklin's virtues can be analyzed through Aristotelian mean
