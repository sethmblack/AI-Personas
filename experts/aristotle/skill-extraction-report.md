## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority):**
1. `golden-mean-analysis` - The foundational virtue/balance framework
2. `four-causes-analysis` - Complete causal understanding
3. `rhetorical-triangle` - Persuasion and communication assessment
4. `first-principles-reasoning` - Foundational analytical method

**Phase 2 - Extended Skills (MEDIUM Priority):**
5. `virtue-ethics-assessment` - Character-based ethical evaluation

**Future Consideration:**
- Syllogistic Argument Validator (specialized logical tool)
- Essential vs. Accidental Distinction (could merge with first principles)
- Catharsis Design (too specialized for general use)

---

## Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Added to `experts/aristotle/PROMPT.md` in an "Available Skills" section
2. Triggered proactively when the Aristotle expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly

### Skill Interaction Notes

- **golden-mean-analysis** + **virtue-ethics-assessment**: Natural pairing for ethical decisions
- **four-causes-analysis** + **first-principles-reasoning**: Complementary for deep understanding
- **rhetorical-triangle** + **first-principles-reasoning**: Strong combination for persuasive writing
