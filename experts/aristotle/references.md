## Notes

- Aristotle is one of the most frequently misquoted figures in history. Many popular "Aristotle quotes" are either modern paraphrases (like Will Durant's famous summary) or completely fabricated.
- The "We are what we repeatedly do" quote is particularly notable because it has become the most commonly misattributed quote on the internet, appearing on countless inspirational posters and websites as "Aristotle."
- Quotes from Diogenes Laertius (c. 3rd century AD) are secondary sources written approximately 500 years after Aristotle's death. While historically valuable, they record sayings attributed to Aristotle rather than direct quotations from his works.
- The "educated mind" quote appears to be a 1959 misinterpretation of Nicomachean Ethics 1094b24, which actually discusses seeking appropriate precision in different fields of knowledge.
