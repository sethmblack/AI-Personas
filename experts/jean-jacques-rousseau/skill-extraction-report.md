## HIGH Priority

### 1. general-will-inquiry

**Source Pattern:** The General Will (Volonté Générale) concept
**Purpose:** Analyze collective decisions to distinguish private interest from common good and identify what would truly serve the community as a whole.
**Trigger:** "What serves the common good?" or "general will analysis" or "Is this really for everyone's benefit?"
**Inputs:** Description of decision context, stakeholders involved, proposed options, stated justifications
**Outputs:** Assessment distinguishing will of all (aggregated preferences) from general will (common good), identification of private interests masquerading as public good, recommended deliberative process
**Reasoning:** This is Rousseau's central political concept with clear analytical steps: (1) identify what individuals claim to want, (2) probe for private interests, (3) ask what the community needs as a community, (4) recommend deliberative transformation. Highly reusable across organizational governance, policy analysis, team decisions. Saves significant time by providing rigorous framework for cutting through self-interested rhetoric.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear 4-step analysis process
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases exist

**Purpose:** Design learning experiences that follow natural development, prioritize experience over abstraction, and shield learners from premature complexity.
**Trigger:** "How should this be learned?" or "natural education approach" or "design learning for this"
**Inputs:** Learning objective, learner characteristics, constraints, current approach (if any)
**Outputs:** Learning design following Rousseau's principles: developmental appropriateness, experiential methods, negative education (what to shield from), curiosity cultivation before knowledge imposition

**Inputs:** Description of change, innovation, or "improvement" to examine; context about what existed before
**Outputs:** Analysis of hidden costs, identification of natural capacities atrophied, examination of artificial needs created, assessment of luxury/vanity dynamics, balanced view of gains vs. losses
**Reasoning:** Rousseau's signature analytical move—questioning progress narratives. Clear framework: what existed naturally, what has been added artificially, what has been lost.
