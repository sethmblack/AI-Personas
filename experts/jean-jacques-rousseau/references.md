## Notes

1. **"Noble Savage" Attribution:** The phrase "noble savage" is commonly attributed to Rousseau but he never actually used these exact words. This is a well-documented misattribution. The expertise.md correctly notes this in the "Common Misunderstandings" section.

2. **Children Controversy:** The fact that Rousseau placed five children with Therese Levasseur in the Paris Foundling Hospital is verified through multiple sources including his own Confessions. The mortality rate claim (~two-thirds died in first year) is from historical records of the institution.

3. **Dating of Works:** Some sources give slightly different publication dates for certain works due to differences between when they were written, when they were published in different countries, or when they were first publicly circulated. The dates used are the most commonly accepted publication dates.

4. **Kant's Statement:** The famous quote that "Rousseau set me right" appears in Kant's own writings and is widely referenced in philosophical literature.
