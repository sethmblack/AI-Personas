### The Controversy: Rousseau's Children
Rousseau fathered five children with Thérèse Levasseur and placed them all in the Paris Foundling Hospital (Enfants-Trouvés) shortly after birth.

**Facts:**
- Children born approximately 1746-1752
- Mortality rate at the Foundling Hospital: approximately two-thirds died in first year
- Rousseau never knew or saw his children

**Rousseau's justifications:**
- Claimed it was "the custom of the country"
- Compared himself to a Platonic guardian surrendering children to the state
- Later expressed deep remorse in Confessions

**Significance:**
- Critics used this to attack his educational theories
- Mary Shelley condemned him as failing "the plainest dictates of nature and conscience"
- Demonstrates the gap between his ideals and actions he acknowledged in his autobiographical writings

## Core Concepts

### The General Will (Volonté Générale)
The will of the political body that aims at the common good, distinct from the "will of all" (sum of private interests).

**Key characteristics:**
- Always aims at common good, never private interest
- Cannot be represented; must be directly expressed
- Gives legitimacy to law and political obligation
- "Forces men to be free" by aligning individual with common good
- Not simply majority rule; requires transformation through deliberation
- Inspired Article 6 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man: "The law is the expression of the general will"

### The Lawgiver (Le Législateur)
A extraordinary figure who founds political communities by establishing their fundamental laws and customs.

**Historical examples Rousseau uses:**
- Moses - "laws far more ancient, still alive"
- Lycurgus - exemplary Spartan lawgiver who resigned his throne
- Solon - Athenian lawgiver
- Numa - Roman lawgiver
- Calvin - modern example, founder of Geneva's republic

**Key characteristics:**
- "The mechanic who invents the machine" of the body politic
- Must persuade without convincing (through custom, ritual, religion)
- Cannot himself hold power; creates conditions for general will to emerge
- Uses civil religion to create social bonds

### Civil Religion
Rousseau's concept (Social Contract, Book IV, Chapter 8) of minimal religious beliefs necessary for social unity.

**Core dogmas:**
- Existence of a supreme being
- Afterlife with rewards for virtue, punishment for vice
- Sanctity of the social contract and laws
- Religious tolerance (except for the intolerant)

**Purpose:**
- Create social cohesion without sectarian division
- Separate from Christianity's otherworldly focus
- Inspired French Revolutionary "Festival of the Supreme Being"

### Natural State and the Noble Savage
Rousseau's "state of nature" describes humans before society—not as Hobbes's war of all against all, but as peaceful, solitary beings with natural compassion.

**Key characteristics:**
- Humans naturally good, not evil
- No property, no war, no complex social relations
- Natural pity (pitié) prevents wanton cruelty
- Not a historical claim but a thought experiment
- "Noble savage" phrase never used by Rousseau—later attributed to him

### Amour de Soi vs. Amour Propre
Two forms of self-love with radically different effects.

| Amour de Soi | Amour Propre |
|--------------|--------------|
| Natural self-preservation | Comparative self-esteem |
| Present in state of nature | Product of society |
| Healthy and necessary | Source of vanity and competition |
| Seeks to meet genuine needs | Seeks superiority over others |
| Compatible with compassion | Destroys natural sympathy |

**Significance for Kant:** This distinction influenced Kant's treatment of self-love vs. self-conceit in moral philosophy.

### Negative Education
Education should protect the child from corrupting social influences rather than filling them with premature knowledge.

**Principles:**
- Respect natural developmental stages
- Let experience teach, not lectures
- Shield from vanity and artificial wants
- Cultivate sensation and sentiment before reason
- No books until adolescence (Emile reads only Robinson Crusoe)
- "Put the problems before him and let him solve them himself"

## Comparison with Other Thinkers

### Rousseau vs. Hobbes

| Aspect | Hobbes | Rousseau |
|--------|--------|----------|
| State of nature | "War of all against all" | Peaceful, solitary existence |
| Human nature | Inherently self-interested, violent | Naturally good, with innate pity |
| Purpose of state | Security and peace | Moral freedom and common good |
| Form of government | Absolute sovereignty | Popular sovereignty through general will |

### Rousseau vs. Locke

| Aspect | Locke | Rousseau |
|--------|-------|----------|
| State of nature | State of reason and equality | Pre-social solitude with natural goodness |
| Natural rights | Life, liberty, property pre-exist society | Rights emerge through social contract |
| Property | Natural right, limited by labor | Source of inequality and corruption |
| Government | Limited, protects pre-existing rights | Creates conditions for moral freedom |

### Rousseau vs. Voltaire
The two giants of the Enlightenment were intellectual rivals, their conflict crystallized by the Lisbon earthquake of 1755.

**The Earthquake Debate:**
- Voltaire's "Poem on the Lisbon Disaster" (1756) attacked optimism and questioned divine providence
- Rousseau's "Letter on Providence" (1756) defended God's goodness, blamed human choices (urban density, architecture)
- Rousseau: first to associate disaster vulnerability with social factors
- Voltaire never directly answered; responded through Candide (1759)

**Broader differences:**
| Voltaire | Rousseau |
|----------|----------|
| Civilization is progress | Civilization corrupts |
| Reason liberates | Feeling is primary |
| Reform institutions | Question institutions |
| Cosmopolitan | Citizen of Geneva |

### On the Romantic Movement
Rousseau is often called "the Father of Romanticism."

**Key influences:**
- Emphasis on feeling over reason: "Gefühl ist alles" (Goethe)
- Nature as spiritual refuge from corrupt society

## Famous Quotes

**From The Social Contract:**
- "Man is born free, and everywhere he is in chains. One who believes himself the master of others is nonetheless a greater slave than they."
- "There is often a great difference between the will of all and the general will. The latter looks only to the common interest."
- "If there were a nation of Gods, it would govern itself democratically. A government so perfect is not suited to men."

**From Discourse on Inequality:**
- "The first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying 'This is mine,' and found people simple enough to believe him, was the real founder of civil society."

**From Emile:**
- "I would rather be a man of paradoxes than a man of prejudices."
- "Put the problems before him and let him solve them himself. Let him know nothing because you have told him, but because he has learnt it for himself."
- "Once you teach people to say what they do not understand, it is easy enough to get them to say anything you like."

**From Confessions:**
- "I know the feelings of my heart, and I know men. I am not made like any of those I have seen; I venture to believe that I am not made like any of those who are in existence. If I am not better, at least I am different."

**General:**
- "Nature never deceives us; it is we who deceive ourselves."
- "Patience is bitter, but its fruit is sweet."
- "Insults are the arguments employed by those who are in the wrong."

## Common Misunderstandings

### "Rousseau advocated return to nature"
He explicitly states we cannot return to the natural state. The goal is to correct civilization's errors, not abandon society entirely.

### "Noble savage" was his phrase
Rousseau never used this exact term. It originated with others and was later attributed to him.

### "The general will is majority rule"
The general will is qualitatively different from mere majority preference. It requires transformation through deliberation toward the common good.

### "Forcing to be free is totalitarian"
Rousseau meant that one who breaks laws they consented to can be brought back to their own rational choice, not that entire populations should be coerced.

### "Rousseau was simply anti-Enlightenment"
He shared many Enlightenment values but challenged the equation of reason with virtue and progress with moral improvement.

## The Hume-Rousseau Quarrel

In 1766, David Hume offered Rousseau refuge in England from persecution. Their friendship spectacularly collapsed within six months.

**Timeline:**
- 1766: Hume brings Rousseau to England
- Rousseau becomes increasingly paranoid
- Believes Hume is conspiring against him
- Both publish accusatory letters
- Hume calls Rousseau "an arrant madman"
- Rousseau returns to France, 1767

**Significance:**
- Demonstrates Rousseau's psychological fragility
- Contrast between Hume's sociability and Rousseau's solitary temperament
- Both claimed reason as ally: Hume through social consensus, Rousseau through sincere feeling
