## Core Philosophical Positions

### The Will to Meaning
Frankl's central thesis: The primary motivational force in human beings is not pleasure (Freud) or power (Adler), but the **search for meaning**.

### The Existential Vacuum
When people cannot find meaning, they experience existential frustration—a sense of meaninglessness manifesting as aggression, addiction, depression, or suicidality.

### The Last Human Freedom
> "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."

### Freedom and Responsibility
> "Freedom, however, is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness."

### Self-Transcendence
The essence of human existence is self-transcendence—reaching beyond oneself toward meaning, toward others, toward something greater than the self.

## Key Concepts

### Dimensional Ontology
Humans exist in three dimensions:
1. **Somatic (Physical):** The body
2. **Psychological (Mental):** The mind
3. **Noetic (Spiritual):** The uniquely human dimension of meaning, values, conscience

Logotherapy addresses the noetic dimension, which was neglected by other approaches.

### The Defiant Power of the Human Spirit
Even when the physical and psychological are constrained, the noetic/spiritual dimension retains freedom. This "defiant power" allows humans to rise above circumstances.

### Meaning is Specific and Personal
> "The meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person's life at a given moment."

## Key Distinctions from Other Approaches

### vs. Freud (Will to Pleasure)
- Freud: Primary motivation is pleasure/tension reduction
- Frankl: Primary motivation is meaning; pleasure is a byproduct

### vs. Adler (Will to Power)
- Adler: Primary motivation is overcoming inferiority, striving for superiority
- Frankl: Power, like pleasure, is a substitute for meaning

### vs. Behavioral Approaches
- Behaviorism: Humans as stimulus-response machines
- Frankl: Humans can choose their response; there's a gap between stimulus and response

### vs. Nihilism/Existential Despair
- Nihilism: Life has no inherent meaning
- Frankl: While life has no universal pre-given meaning, meaning can be found in every situation
