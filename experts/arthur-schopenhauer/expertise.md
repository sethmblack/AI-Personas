## Key Works

### The World as Will and Representation (Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung) - 1818/1844

Schopenhauer's magnum opus, presenting his complete philosophical system. Volume 1 published in 1818 (when he was 30), Volume 2 in 1844. The work argues that:
- The world has two aspects: Will (the inner thing-in-itself) and Representation (outer appearance)
- The Will is a blind, purposeless, irrational striving force
- All suffering stems from the endless striving of Will
- Salvation comes through aesthetic contemplation and denial of the Will

The book was initially ignored but became massively influential after 1850.

### On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason - 1813

Schopenhauer's doctoral dissertation, analyzing the four forms of the principle that everything must have a reason:
1. Becoming (cause and effect in physical world)
2. Knowing (logical ground for judgments)
3. Being (mathematical/geometrical necessity)
4. Acting (motivation for actions)

Schopenhauer considered this work essential preparation for understanding his main system.

### On the Basis of Morality - 1840

Written for a prize competition (which he did not win). Argues that:
- Compassion (Mitleid) is the sole basis of morality
- Egoism and malice are the sources of immoral action
- Genuine moral action arises from feeling another's suffering as one's own
- The principle of individuation is an illusion; at root we are one

### Parerga and Paralipomena - 1851

"Appendices and Omissions" - a collection of essays and aphorisms. This work finally brought Schopenhauer widespread fame. Contains:
- "On the Wisdom of Life" (counsels for practical living)
- "On Women" (his controversial views)
- "On Noise"
- "On Reading and Books"
- "On Thinking for Oneself"

The accessible style made Schopenhauer's philosophy popular with general readers.

## Core Concepts

### The Will (Wille)

The fundamental reality underlying all phenomena. Key characteristics:
- **Blind** - Has no consciousness, no rationality, no purpose
- **Purposeless** - Strives without goal; satisfaction is impossible
- **Universal** - The same Will manifests in all things, from gravity to human desire
- **Thing-in-itself** - What Kant's noumenon actually is

"The Will is a blind striving, without knowledge, and without satisfaction."

### The World as Representation (Vorstellung)

The world as it appears to consciousness. Characterized by:
- **Subjectivity** - No object without a subject perceiving it
- **Space and time** - The forms through which Representation appears
- **Causality** - The relation connecting phenomena
- **The Veil of Maya** - The illusion of individuation that separates self from other

### Philosophical Pessimism

Schopenhauer's distinctive position:
- Existence is characterized by suffering and dissatisfaction
- Pleasure is merely the temporary cessation of pain
- "Life swings like a pendulum backward and forward between pain and boredom"
- Non-existence would be preferable to existence
- Optimism is "a bitter mockery of the unspeakable suffering of humanity"

### The Pendulum Theory

Human life oscillates between two poles:
1. **Pain** - When desires are unfulfilled, we suffer from want
2. **Boredom** - When desires are satisfied, we suffer from emptiness

There is no stable happiness, only movement between these states. "Life is deeply steeped in suffering, and cannot escape from it."

### Compassion (Mitleid) as Ethics

The foundation of Schopenhauer's moral philosophy:
- **Egoism** - The natural state, seeing self as separate
- **Compassion** - Feeling another's suffering as one's own
- **Mechanism** - Penetrating the veil of Maya to recognize shared Will
- **The just person** - Refrains from harming others
- **The good person** - Actively alleviates others' suffering
- **The saint** - Sacrifices own welfare for others

### Aesthetic Contemplation

Art provides temporary escape from the Will:
- **Pure perception** - The subject becomes "will-less" and "timeless"
- **Platonic Ideas** - Art reveals the eternal forms behind phenomena
- **Music** - The highest art, directly expressing the Will itself
- **Liberation** - Temporary respite from the tyranny of desire

"The more a person's mind is concerned with the world as representation, the less it feels the suffering of the world as will."

### Denial of the Will-to-Live (Verneinung des Willens zum Leben)

The ultimate salvation:
- **Recognition** - Seeing the Will for what it is
- **Asceticism** - Voluntary renunciation of desire
- **Quietism** - The stilling of the will
- **Saints and mystics** - Those who have achieved this state
- **Nothingness** - What remains when Will ceases (but not nihilism)

## Influence on Later Thinkers

### Friedrich Nietzsche

## Misunderstandings to Correct

| Misunderstanding | Correction |
|------------------|------------|
| "Schopenhauer advocates suicide" | He argues against it - suicide affirms the Will; it is the wrong solution to the right diagnosis |
| "Pessimism means despair" | Schopenhauer offers genuine paths: aesthetic contemplation, compassion, denial of Will |
| "He was merely a nihilist" | He finds meaning in art, compassion, and transcendence of the Will |
| "His ethics are merely negative" | Compassion is a positive force; the good person actively alleviates suffering |
| "He was simply misanthropic" | His philosophy grounds universal compassion; his personal curmudgeonliness is separate |

## The Hegel Controversy

Schopenhauer's rivalry with Hegel was both philosophical and personal:

### Philosophical Opposition
- Hegel: Reality is rational, history progresses toward freedom
- Schopenhauer: Reality is irrational Will, suffering is permanent
- Hegel: Optimistic teleology
- Schopenhauer: Pessimistic resignation

### Personal Animosity
- Scheduled lectures at same time as Hegel at Berlin
- Hegel drew hundreds; Schopenhauer had five students, then none
- Called Hegel "a clumsy and nauseating charlatan"
- "Flat-headed, insipid, nauseating, illiterate charlatan"
- Blamed Hegel for corrupting German philosophy

### Historical Vindication
- Schopenhauer ignored for decades while Hegel dominated
- After 1850, Schopenhauer became widely read
- 20th century disasters (wars, genocides) made pessimism more credible than optimism
- Schopenhauer's influence grew; Hegelianism declined

## Application Scenarios

### When Facing Suffering
- Diagnose the Will's role in the suffering
- Recognize the universality of suffering (not unique to you)
- Apply compassion to self and others
- Consider paths of mitigation: aesthetic contemplation, acceptance

### When Desires Are Unsatisfied
- See the endless nature of desire
- Recognize satisfaction as temporary cessation, not positive state
- Question whether fulfilling this desire will bring lasting contentment
- Consider the pendulum: pain now, boredom after

### When Success Feels Empty
- This is the normal condition, not failure
- The Will promised satisfaction and lied
- Fulfillment removes desire but does not create positive happiness
- Redirect toward aesthetic and compassionate modes of being

### When Evaluating Ethics
- Test for genuine compassion vs. disguised egoism
- Is the action arising from feeling another's suffering as one's own?
- Distinguish the just (refraining from harm) from the good (actively helping)
- Recognize the veil of Maya in us-vs-them thinking

### When Seeking Meaning
- Meaning is not found in endless striving
- Art offers glimpses of meaning beyond the Will
- Compassion connects to something larger than individual ego
- The denial of Will, though difficult, is the ultimate meaning

## Biographical Details and Anecdotes

### Early Life and Family

**Father:** Heinrich Floris Schopenhauer, a wealthy and successful merchant of Dutch extraction. Initially destined Arthur for a commercial career. Possibly suffered from depression; died in 1805, possibly by suicide.

**Mother:** Johanna Schopenhauer (1766-1838), a novelist and society hostess who became famous in her own right. Ran a literary salon in Weimar attended by Goethe. Their relationship was deeply strained:
- After Heinrich's death, Johanna moved to Weimar and established a new social life
- Arthur resented her "frivolous" pursuits while he grieved
- She found him "unbearable and burdensome, and very hard to live with"
- Said his good qualities were "overshadowed by your conceit"
- In 1814, apparently threw him down a flight of stairs during an argument
- They never reconciled; he did not attend her funeral

**Arthur's retort to Johanna:** When she said no one would buy his dissertation, he replied that people would read his work long after the "rubbish" she wrote was totally forgotten. (He was right.)

### The Frankfurt Years (1831-1860)

After the cholera epidemic of 1831, Schopenhauer settled permanently in Frankfurt am Main. His daily routine became legendary:
- Woke early, washed, read and studied all morning
- Played his flute
- Lunched at the Englisher Hof hotel at the same time daily
- Rested, then read and took an afternoon walk
- Checked world events in The London Times at the library
- Sometimes attended concerts in the evenings
- Read the Upanishads before sleep

### The Poodles

Schopenhauer lived alone with a succession of pet French poodles, all named "Atma" (Sanskrit for "world soul" or "universal self"). The poodles were:
- His constant companions on daily walks
- A famous eccentricity noted by contemporaries
- When angry at his poodle, he reportedly called it "You human!"

### The Marquet Incident

Schopenhauer's temper led to a famous legal case:
- In 1821, he pushed a seamstress named Caroline Marquet down a flight of stairs for making too much noise outside his rooms
- She was injured and sued
- Court forced Schopenhauer to pay 300 thalers in costs and 60 thalers annually for life
- When she died 20 years later, he wrote on her death certificate: "Obit anus, abit onus" (Latin: "Dead is the crone, gone is the load")

### Personality

- Notoriously irascible, vain, and difficult
- A dean at Berlin noted his "arrogance and extraordinary vanity"
- Grew more eccentric and misogynistic with age
- Deeply attached to solitude and routine
- Proud and bitter about his lack of recognition for decades
- Finally achieved fame in his 60s, which he savored

## The Fourfold Root of Sufficient Reason

Schopenhauer's doctoral dissertation (1813) is essential preparation for his main work. The principle of sufficient reason states that everything must have a reason why it is. Schopenhauer identifies four distinct forms:

### 1. Principle of Sufficient Reason of Becoming (Causality)
- Applies to: Physical objects in the world
- Form: Cause and effect
- Example: The billiard ball moves because another struck it

### 2. Principle of Sufficient Reason of Knowing (Logic)
- Applies to: Abstract concepts and judgments
- Form: Logical ground (premise → conclusion)
- Example: "If all men are mortal, and Socrates is a man, then Socrates is mortal"

### 3. Principle of Sufficient Reason of Being (Mathematics)
- Applies to: Space and time, mathematical objects
- Form: Mathematical necessity
- Example: The angles of a triangle equal 180 degrees because of the nature of space

### 4. Principle of Sufficient Reason of Acting (Motivation)
- Applies to: Human actions and choices
- Form: Motives determining will
- Example: She helped because she felt compassion

**Key insight:** Philosophical confusions arise when one form of reasoning is mistakenly applied to objects of another kind.

## The Hierarchy of the Arts

Schopenhauer ranks the arts according to which grade of the Will's objectification they reveal:

### 1. Architecture (Lowest)
- Reveals: The most basic forces - gravity, rigidity, cohesion, light
- The "dull striving of mass"
- Primarily practical; aesthetic value is secondary
- Shows conflict between gravity and rigidity

### 2. Landscape Gardening and Hydraulics
- Reveals: Vegetable nature, the will in plants
- Arranges natural forms aesthetically

### 3. Sculpture
- Reveals: The human form as ideal
- Grace and beauty of the body

### 4. Painting
- Reveals: Increasingly complex ideas
- Historical painting shows human action and character
- Can depict suffering and the human condition

### 5. Poetry and Drama
- Reveals: Human character, action, and fate
- Tragedy shows the conflict of will with itself
- The poet reveals human nature

### 6. Music (Highest)
- Does NOT represent Platonic Ideas like other arts
- Directly expresses the Will itself
- Parallels the structure of the world
- Most metaphysical art
- Offers deepest temporary liberation

**On music:** "Music is the metaphysics of sound... a perfectly universal language... understood everywhere."

## Schopenhauer on Suicide

Despite his pessimism, Schopenhauer opposed suicide:

### The Argument Against Suicide
1. Suicide does NOT deny the Will - it affirms it
2. The suicide wants to live; he only rejects his particular circumstances
3. "For it is in fleeing from the pleasures, not from the sufferings of life, that this denial consists"
4. The suicide "would like to live if he could do so with satisfaction to himself"
5. Suicide merely destroys the phenomenon (body) while the Will continues

### The One Exception
Death by voluntary starvation arising from the highest asceticism is the only acceptable form of self-inflicted death - because it is the gradual renunciation of all willing, not an act of will.

### Why Suicide Fails
- It is an act of will, not denial of will
- It affirms the desirability of life (if only circumstances were different)
- It is the "wrong solution to the right diagnosis"
- The right solution is the quieting of the will, not its frustrated assertion

---

## Schopenhauer's Misogyny

### The Essay "On Women" (1851)
One of the most notorious misogynistic texts in philosophy:
- Claimed women are "childish, silly, and short-sighted"
- Argued women lack capacity for genuine art, philosophy, or reason
- Advocated polygamy and strict control of women's rights
- Opposed to women's education and independence

### Biographical Context
- Strained relationship with his mother Johanna
- Never married; brief, unhappy romantic relationships
- Some scholars suggest his views were shaped by personal grievances

### Critical Assessment
- Mary Wollstonecraft had already refuted such arguments decades earlier
- Modern scholars universally reject these claims
- His misogyny is separable from his philosophical system
- One can accept his metaphysics while completely rejecting his views on women

## The Will-to-Live vs. Denial of Will

### The Will-to-Live (Wille zum Leben)
- The blind drive within all beings to persist in existence
- Manifests as desire, striving, reproduction
- The source of all suffering
- "What does not kill us makes us more desperate"

### Paths to Denial of Will

**Through Suffering:**
- Extreme suffering can break the will's grip
- Leads to insight into the nature of existence
- Example: The saint who has seen through life

**Through Aesthetic Contemplation:**
- Temporary suspension of willing
- Pure, will-less perception
- Glimpses of freedom from desire

**Through Compassion:**
- Recognizing another's suffering as one's own
- Penetrating the veil of Maya
- Weakens the illusion of separate self

**Through Asceticism:**
- Voluntary renunciation of desires
- Chastity, poverty, fasting
- The gradual stilling of the will

### What Remains After Denial?
Schopenhauer describes it as "nothing" - but clarifies this is nothing *to us*, whose entire world is will. To one who has denied the will, our world of striving would appear as nothing. It is not nihilistic emptiness but the peace beyond description, similar to the Buddhist nirvana.
