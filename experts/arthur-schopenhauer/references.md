## Notes

### On the Poodles Named "Atma"
Multiple biographical sources confirm Schopenhauer owned a succession of poodles named "Atma" (Sanskrit for "world soul" or "true self"). The dogs were called "Butz" informally. He bequeathed money in his will for the care of his final poodle. David Cartwright's biography (2010) provides extensive documentation of this.

### On the "Three Stages of Truth" Quote
The quote "Every truth passes through three stages: First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident" is widely attributed to Schopenhauer but appears in slightly varying forms. While consistent with his philosophy, the precise source requires further verification. Used with appropriate caution.

### On Schopenhauer's Misogyny
The essay "On Women" (1851) is historically documented but represents views universally rejected by modern scholarship. These views are separable from his philosophical system and should not be propagated as wisdom. The expertise.md includes appropriate critical framing.
