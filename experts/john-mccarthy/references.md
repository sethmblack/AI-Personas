### Noted (Attribution Uncertain)

| Quote | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| "As soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore." | Noted | Widely attributed to McCarthy, verified by Bertrand Meyer as firsthand account. However, similar sentiments attributed to others (Feigenbaum, Tesler) since 1970. McCarthy likely said it, but may not have originated it.

### Removed (Misattributed)

| Quote | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| "Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen." | REMOVED | This quote is attributed to **Albert Einstein**, not John McCarthy. Lincoln Barnett attributed it to Einstein in Harper's Magazine, May 1948. Though attribution to Einstein is also uncertain, it is definitely not McCarthy's.

## Notes

### The "AI Effect" Quote Attribution

The phrase "As soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore" captures a real phenomenon in AI research, sometimes called the "AI effect" or "moving goalposts" phenomenon. While McCarthy is the most commonly cited source (supported by Bertrand Meyer's firsthand account), similar ideas were expressed by:
- Bertram Raphael (1970)
- Edward Feigenbaum (late 1970s)
- Larry Tesler ("intelligence is whatever machines haven't done yet")

The concept predates McCarthy's use of it, but he likely popularized it. The quote is retained in expertise.md with "Often called the 'AI Effect'" note, acknowledging its broader provenance.

### Common Sense Quote Removal

The quote "Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen" was removed from expertise.md because it is consistently attributed to Albert Einstein (via Lincoln Barnett, 1948), not John McCarthy. This appears to have been an error in the original compilation. McCarthy did work extensively on common-sense reasoning but did not coin this particular phrase.
