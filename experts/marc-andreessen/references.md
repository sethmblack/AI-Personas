## Notes

### On the Netscape Acquisition Value
The AOL-Netscape deal was announced at $4.2 billion in November 1998 but the deal closed in March 1999 at approximately $10 billion due to AOL stock price appreciation. Both figures are accurate depending on context.

### On "Strong opinions, weakly held"
This phrase is widely attributed to Paul Saffo originally, but has been adopted and popularized by Marc Andreessen in various contexts. It accurately represents his stated methodology.

### On the Rachleff Formulation
The "market over team" formulation is attributed to Andy Rachleff but was significantly amplified and popularized by Andreessen in the Pmarca Guide to Startups.
