## Extraction Analysis

### Candidate 1: software-disruption-analysis

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1 (Actionable): **Yes** - Clear steps: identify industry, map manual processes, find information asymmetries, identify transaction costs, assess software transformation potential
- Criterion 2 (Invocable): **Yes** - "Analyze how software is disrupting X industry" or "Is this industry being eaten by software?"
- Criterion 3 (Scoped): **Yes** - Single responsibility: analyze software disruption potential for a given industry or business
- Criterion 4 (Reusable): **Yes** - Applies to any industry, business model, or competitive analysis
- Criterion 5 (Valuable): **Yes** - Saves significant strategic analysis time, provides systematic lens for evaluating opportunities

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

**Overlap Check:** Partial overlap with `disruption-detection` (30%) - different focus (general disruption vs. software-specific)

---

### Candidate 2: product-market-fit-diagnosis

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1 (Actionable): **Yes** - Clear diagnostic steps based on specific symptoms (word of mouth, sales cycle, usage growth, customer pull)
- Criterion 2 (Invocable): **Yes** - "Do we have product-market fit?" or "Diagnose our product-market fit"
- Criterion 3 (Scoped): **Yes** - Single responsibility: diagnose current PMF status and recommend next steps
- Criterion 4 (Reusable): **Yes** - Applies to any startup, product, or venture at any stage
- Criterion 5 (Valuable): **Yes** - Most important diagnostic for startup success, saves wasted effort on wrong priorities

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

**Overlap Check:** Partial overlap with `startup-idea-evaluation` (40%) - Paul Graham skill focuses on idea quality, this focuses on PMF diagnosis for existing products

---

### Candidate 3: market-over-team-analysis

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1 (Actionable): **Yes** - Steps: assess market size, evaluate market dynamics, compare to team strength, apply Rachleff formulation
- Criterion 2 (Invocable): **Yes** - "Is this a good market?" or "Market vs. team assessment"
- Criterion 3 (Scoped): **Yes** - Single responsibility: evaluate market quality relative to team
- Criterion 4 (Reusable): **Yes** - Applies to investment decisions, career choices, startup pivots
- Criterion 5 (Valuable): **Yes** - Counter-intuitive insight that prevents wasted effort on bad markets

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

**Overlap Check:** Low overlap with `market-dynamics-assessment` (25%) - different framework (Andreessen's market-over-team vs. general dynamics)

---

### Candidate 4: tech-optimism-reframe

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1 (Actionable): **Yes** - Steps: identify pessimistic framing, apply historical parallels, reframe through abundance lens, push toward building
- Criterion 2 (Invocable): **Yes** - "Apply tech optimism lens" or "Reframe this pessimistically framed problem"
- Criterion 3 (Scoped): **Yes** - Single responsibility: reframe negative tech narratives through optimist lens
- Criterion 4 (Reusable): **Yes** - Applies to any technology debate, policy discussion, or fear-based criticism
- Criterion 5 (Valuable): **Yes** - Provides counter-narrative framework, useful for building motivation and strategic clarity

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

**Overlap Check:** No significant overlap found

---

### Candidate 5: feature-vs-product-test

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1 (Actionable): **Yes** - Steps: identify platform adjacency, assess standalone viability, evaluate defensibility, determine if feature or product
- Criterion 2 (Invocable): **Yes** - "Is this a feature or a product?" or "Can this be a standalone company?"
- Criterion 3 (Scoped): **Yes** - Single responsibility: distinguish features from products
- Criterion 4 (Reusable): **Yes** - Applies to any startup idea, product concept, or investment evaluation
- Criterion 5 (Valuable): **Yes** - Prevents building features that get absorbed by platforms, saves major strategic errors

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

**Overlap Check:** No significant overlap found

---

### Candidate 6: tam-expansion-analysis

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Criterion 1 (Actionable): **Yes** - Steps: identify current market constraints, assess how software removes constraints, calculate expanded TAM, apply Uber/taxi example pattern
- Criterion 2 (Invocable): **Yes** - "How big could this market become?" or "What's the expanded TAM?"
- Criterion 3 (Scoped): **Yes** - Single responsibility: analyze market expansion potential when software transforms constraints
- Criterion 4 (Reusable): **Yes** - Applies to market sizing, pitch evaluation, investment analysis
- Criterion 5 (Valuable): **Yes** - Counter-intuitive insight that existing market size misleads, prevents underestimating opportunities

**Decision:** CANDIDATE

**Overlap Check:** Partial overlap with `market-creation-analysis` (35%) - different focus (TAM expansion vs. creating entirely new markets)

---

## HIGH Priority

### 1. software-disruption-analysis
**Source Pattern:** "Software Is Eating the World" framework
**Purpose:** Analyze any industry through the lens of software transformation to identify disruption opportunities and threats
**Trigger:** "Analyze how software is disrupting X" or "Is this industry being eaten by software?"
**Inputs:** Industry or business to analyze, current state description
**Outputs:** Disruption assessment including: manual processes that can be automated, information asymmetries that can be eliminated, transaction costs that can be reduced, timeline and key players
**Reasoning:** Core Andreessen framework, used constantly in investment analysis, high strategic value for any business evaluation, clear 4-step process

### 2. product-market-fit-diagnosis
**Source Pattern:** Product-Market Fit from Pmarca Guide to Startups Part 4
**Purpose:** Diagnose whether a product/startup has achieved product-market fit and prescribe next steps
**Trigger:** "Do we have product-market fit?" or "Diagnose our PMF status" or "Why isn't growth happening?"
**Inputs:** Current metrics (usage, word of mouth, sales cycle, customer feedback), startup stage
**Outputs:** PMF diagnosis (BPMF/APMF), specific symptoms identified, recommended actions based on status
**Reasoning:** Most important startup diagnostic, saves massive wasted effort, clear symptom-based diagnosis framework, Andreessen's most influential concept

### 3. feature-vs-product-test
**Source Pattern:** Features vs. Products pattern in thinking
**Purpose:** Determine whether a startup idea is a standalone product or a feature that will be absorbed by larger platforms
**Trigger:** "Is this a feature or a product?" or "Will this get absorbed by big tech?"
**Inputs:** Startup/product idea, adjacent platforms, competitive landscape
**Outputs:** Classification (feature/product), defensibility assessment, platform absorption risk, recommendation
**Reasoning:** Critical strategic filter, prevents building companies that get absorbed, clear decision framework

---

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. market-over-team-analysis
**Source Pattern:** Rachleff/Andreessen market vs. team formulation
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether a market is good enough to support success regardless of team quality
**Trigger:** "Is this a good market?" or "Should I join this startup/industry?"
**Inputs:** Market characteristics, team quality assessment, competitive dynamics
**Outputs:** Market quality rating, team-market match assessment, recommendation based on Rachleff formulation
**Reasoning:** Counter-intuitive insight (market > team), useful for investment and career decisions, 3+ uses/week potential

### 5. tech-optimism-reframe
**Source Pattern:** Techno-Optimist Manifesto, "It's Time to Build"
**Purpose:** Reframe pessimistic narratives about technology through abundance and building lens
**Trigger:** "Apply tech optimism lens" or "Why is tech criticism wrong here?"
**Inputs:** Pessimistic claim or fear about technology, context
**Outputs:** Historical parallels showing similar fears were wrong, abundance framing, building-focused alternative narrative
**Reasoning:** Useful for debates, content creation, and maintaining motivation; less frequent use than core frameworks

### 6. tam-expansion-analysis
**Source Pattern:** Market Sizing Through Expansion, Uber/taxi example
**Purpose:** Calculate potential market size by considering how software removes current constraints
**Trigger:** "How big could this market become?" or "What's the real TAM?"
**Inputs:** Current market size, existing constraints, proposed software solution
**Outputs:** Current vs. expanded TAM, constraint removal analysis, comparable examples (Uber, etc.)
**Reasoning:** Counter-intuitive market sizing approach, useful for pitches and investment analysis
