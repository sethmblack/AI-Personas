Criterion 3 (Scoped): **Yes** - Focused on power distribution in economic systems
Criterion 4 (Reusable): **Yes** - Applies to economic policy, organizational structure, technology impact analysis

Criterion 5 (Valuable): **Yes** - Powerful persuasion technique
Decision: **CANDIDATE** - But consider merging with declaration-drafting as a sub-procedure

### Pattern: Jefferson-Hamilton Debate Framework
Criterion 1 (Actionable): **No** - Reference/analytical framework, not procedural
Criterion 2 (Invocable): **No** - Invokes comparative analysis, not a method
Criterion 3 (Scoped): **Yes** - Focused on centralization/decentralization tensions
Criterion 4 (Reusable): **Yes** - Applies to many governance debates
Criterion 5 (Valuable): **Yes** - Illuminates enduring tensions
Decision: **REJECT** - Reference knowledge for contextualization, not procedural skill

## HIGH Priority

### 1. jeffersonian-first-principles

**Source Pattern:** First Principles Analysis
**Purpose:** Guide users through systematic evaluation of policies, decisions, or institutions by tracing reasoning back to natural rights, social contract theory, and self-evident truths.
**Trigger:** "Help me analyze this from first principles," "What rights are at stake here?," "Is this policy justified?," "Evaluate this decision ethically"
**Inputs:** The policy, decision, or institution to evaluate; relevant stakeholders and affected parties; context and constraints
**Outputs:** Identification of natural rights at stake; social contract analysis; harm principle application; self-evidence test; distribution effects analysis; reasoned conclusion
**Reasoning:** Core Jefferson methodology that underlies all his political thought. Highly reusable across policy analysis, ethical reasoning, organizational design. Provides rigorous framework where most analysis remains superficial. Estimated 3+ uses/week in governance, policy, and ethics contexts.

---

### 2. declaration-drafting

**Source Pattern:** Declaration Framework (incorporating Enumerated Grievance Framework)
**Purpose:** Guide users through creating foundational documents that establish principles and justify positions, using the structure that made the Declaration of Independence persuasive across centuries.
**Trigger:** "Help me write a mission statement," "Draft founding principles for our organization," "I need to articulate why we're making this change," "Create a manifesto for X"
**Inputs:** The cause, organization, or change requiring articulation; core principles to establish; specific grievances or reasons for change; target audience; prior context
**Outputs:** Philosophical preamble with self-evident principles; application to specific context; enumerated specific reasons (grievances, needs, or justifications); acknowledgment of alternatives attempted; clear declaration of commitment or action
**Reasoning:** Template that has been adapted by movements worldwide since 1776. High value for startups, movements, organizational change, and personal mission clarity. Combines Jefferson's philosophical framing with his evidentiary rigor. Estimated 2+ uses/week.

---

## MEDIUM Priority

### 3. educational-architecture

**Source Pattern:** Educational Architecture Framework
**Purpose:** Design systematic learning programs using Jefferson's principles from the University of Virginia: clear foundations, disciplinary coherence, learner sovereignty, community integration, and institutional capacity for progress.
**Trigger:** "Design a curriculum for X," "Help me structure this training program," "Create a learning path for our team," "How should I organize this educational content?"
**Inputs:** Subject matter or skills to be taught; target learners and their contexts; time and resource constraints; learning community characteristics; adaptability requirements
**Outputs:** Foundational knowledge identification; disciplinary organization; required vs. elective structure; community/cohort design elements; progress and revision mechanisms
**Reasoning:** University of Virginia remains an influential model. Applicable to corporate training, online courses, bootcamps, and self-directed learning. Less frequently invoked than first-principles or declaration work, but high value when needed. Estimated 1-2 uses/week.

## LOW Priority

None identified. The three candidates above represent Jefferson's most distinctive and actionable contributions.

---

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Agrarian Democracy Lens | Evaluative perspective rather than procedural workflow; functions better as lens within first-principles-analysis than standalone skill |
| Religious Liberty Principle | Too narrow as standalone; harm principle test is subsumed within first-principles-analysis framework |
| Jefferson-Hamilton Debate | Reference/contextual knowledge for understanding tensions; not a procedural methodology |
| Architectural Design Principles | Jefferson's physical architecture (Monticello, UVA buildings) is reference material; the educational philosophy is captured in educational-architecture skill |
| Writing Style Guidelines | Sentence-level craft guidance is reference material integrated into voice definition in PROMPT.md; not a procedural skill |
| Famous Quotes Collection | Reference material for voice authenticity; no procedural workflow |

## Design Notes

### first-principles-analysis vs. declaration-drafting

These skills are related but distinct:
- **first-principles-analysis** is evaluative: it helps assess whether something is justified
- **declaration-drafting** is constructive: it helps articulate and communicate principles

A user might use first-principles-analysis to determine their position, then declaration-drafting to express it. The skills can chain naturally.

### Enumerated Grievance as Sub-procedure

The Enumerated Grievance Framework is absorbed into declaration-drafting as Step 3. It provides the evidentiary rigor that distinguishes a Jefferson-style declaration from vague manifestos. This merger strengthens declaration-drafting without creating a narrow standalone skill.

### Integration with Hamilton Expert

Jefferson and Hamilton skills complement each other:
- Jefferson's jeffersonian-first-principles + Hamilton's comprehensive-argument-construction = rigorous policy proposal
- Jefferson's declaration-drafting + Hamilton's financial-architecture-assessment = principled and practical organizational founding
