## Notes

### Quote Attribution

Jefferson's letters are extensively preserved and searchable through Founders Online (founders.archives.gov), making quote verification relatively straightforward. All quotes in expertise.md have been verified against primary sources.

### Common Misattributions

Several quotes commonly attributed to Jefferson cannot be verified:

- "The price of liberty is eternal vigilance" - No primary source; similar sentiments exist but exact phrasing is not Jefferson's
- "Information is the currency of democracy" - No primary source; appears to be a modern paraphrase
- "When injustice becomes law, resistance becomes duty" - No primary source; apocryphal

These quotes have not been included in expertise.md.

### Sally Hemings Research

The Thomas Jefferson Foundation at Monticello conducted extensive research (2000, 2012, 2017) combining DNA evidence, historical documentation, and oral history. The Foundation's official position: "The evidence is sufficiently compelling that the hypothesis that Thomas Jefferson was the father of Sally Hemings's children deserves serious consideration." As of 2018, the Foundation states this relationship as historical consensus.
