- *The Corsair*, a satirical magazine, initially spared Kierkegaard mockery
- After Kierkegaard attacked P.L. Moller (who wrote for the magazine), became target
- Series of nasty attacks mocking his personal appearance, hunchback, uneven trouser legs
- His daily "people baths" (walks around Copenhagen conversing with people) became impossible
- Became reclusive, unable to endure jeering crowds who stared at him
- Deepened his sense of being the single individual against the crowd

## Major Works

### Either/Or (1843)
Two volumes representing aesthetic and ethical life-views:
- **Part I (A):** Papers of an unnamed aesthete found in secret drawer of a secretary
- Essays on music, seduction, boredom, Mozart's Don Giovanni
- "The Seducer's Diary"—aesthetic manipulation and non-commitment
- **Part II (B):** Judge Wilhelm's letters defending ethical choice
- Defense of marriage as transformation of the aesthetic through commitment
- "Choose yourself"—the self acquires temporal continuity through commitment

Key insight: The aesthetic life is self-defeating; one must choose oneself through ethical commitment. The ethical does not abolish the aesthetic but ennobles it.

### Fear and Trembling (1843)
Meditation on Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22):
- Abraham as "knight of faith"—single individual higher than the universal
- Teleological suspension of the ethical—faith can demand what ethics forbids
- Three movements: infinite resignation, then the absurd movement of faith
- Infinite resignation: giving up Isaac forever. Faith: believing he will be returned
- The paradox: Abraham believes "by virtue of the absurd"
- Mirrors Kierkegaard's sacrifice of Regine—giving her up yet in some sense keeping her
- The knight of faith looks like everyone else but lives in absolute relation to the Absolute

### Repetition (1843)
Haunted by Regine Olsen:
- Constantin Constantius explores whether repetition is possible
- The young man's broken engagement (transparent autobiography)
- Religious repetition vs. aesthetic recollection
- Can what was lost be regained?

### The Concept of Anxiety (1844)
Psychological analysis of anxiety (originally translated as *The Concept of Dread*):
- Anxiety (Angst) differs from fear—fear has specific object, anxiety does not
- Anxiety emerges from freedom—awareness of one's own possibility
- Cliff example: greater than fear of falling is anxiety that one could jump
- "Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom"—gazing into the abyss of choice
- Anxiety preceded Adam's sin—natural reaction when facing freedom
- Original sin understood psychologically through the qualitative leap
- Anxiety not merely psychological state but ontological structure of human being
- Anxiety both attracts and repels—the nothingness of future possibilities
- Positive role: anxiety informs us of choices, brings self-awareness, reveals identity
- Anxiety is the condition for possibility of despair but not same as despair

### The Sickness Unto Death (1849)
Analysis of despair as spiritual condition (by pseudonym Anti-Climacus):
- The sickness unto death is NOT physical death but spiritual death—despair
- "The torment of despair is precisely this inability to die"
- The self: "a relation which relates itself to its own self"
- Synthesis of infinite/finite, temporal/eternal, freedom/necessity
- **Three forms of despair:**
  1. **Unconscious despair:** Not knowing one has a self—accepting finitude without knowing more is possible
  2. **Despair of weakness:** Not willing to be oneself—knowing the self but wishing to lose this painful awareness; arranging finite life to avoid it (comparable to Sartre's bad faith)
  3. **Demonic despair (defiance):** Willing to be oneself without relation to the power that established it—refusing love; the most heightened form
- "The greatest hazard of all, losing the self, can occur very quietly in the world"
- **The cure:** Faith—"In relating itself to itself, and in willing to be itself, the self rests transparently in the power that established it"
- Sin is despair before God; the opposite of sin is not virtue but faith

### Concluding Unscientific Postscript (1846)
Major philosophical statement by Johannes Climacus:
- "Subjectivity is truth" and "truth is subjectivity"
- Not subjectivism but emphasis on HOW one relates to truth
- Objective truth without subjective appropriation is mere information
- Critique of Hegelian system-building
- "An existing individual cannot be systematic"
- Christianity as paradox—the eternal entering time, God becoming man
- Distinction between Religiousness A (immanent) and Religiousness B (paradoxical Christianity)
- Johannes Climacus is a "humorist" who falls short of faith himself

## Key Concepts

### The Three Stages (Spheres) of Existence

**Aesthetic:**
- Life of immediacy, sensation, pleasure, passion
- Two divisions: sensual (basic, natural) and reflective
- Don Giovanni as archetype of sensual aesthetic
- Rotation method—vary pleasures to avoid boredom
- Criteria are pre-moral, unconcerned with good and evil
- The aesthete is defined by what happens to him, not what he chooses
- Eventually leads to despair through lack of continuity

**Ethical:**
- Life of choice, duty, commitment, universal law
- Marriage as paradigm: choosing oneself through temporal commitment
- Judge Wilhelm: one transforms aesthetic through ethical choice
- "Choose despair... for only when I choose despair do I absolutely choose myself"
- The ethical is the universal—rules and norms applying to everyone
- Societal regulations and norms rule life in ethical realm
- Limitation: Cannot account for individual's absolute relation to the Absolute

**Religious:**
- Life of faith—paradox of the individual before God
- Abraham: the single individual higher than the universal
- Teleological suspension of the ethical—faith can override ethics
- "The knight of faith"—one who has made the leap
- Religiousness A (immanent, general religiosity) vs. Religiousness B (Christianity as paradox)
- Total faith in divine providence rules life
- Embracing faith necessarily implies embracing the absurd
- The only way to make life meaningful is faith in God

**Critical insight:** The stages are not simply linear development. The later stages do not replace earlier ones—an ethical person still capable of aesthetic enjoyment, a religious person still capable of both. The difference is internal, not external.

### Anxiety (Angst)

- Not pathological but constitutive of human existence
- Anxiety of innocence—awareness of freedom before the fall
- "Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom which emerges when freedom looks down into its own possibility"
- Both attraction to and repulsion from the nothingness of future possibilities
- Cliff example: the anxiety that one COULD jump is greater than fear of falling
- Anxiety accompanies every significant choice
- Freedom's possibility experienced as vertigo
- Anxiety is not sin but precedes sin—the soul's natural reaction facing the abyss of freedom
- Positive role: anxiety can SAVE us—makes us aware of choices, potential, identity, freedom
- Anxiety is ontological structure, not mere psychological state or mood
- Anxiety is condition for possibility of despair but distinct from despair
- Original sin breaks forth through "qualitative leap" preceded by anxiety

### Despair

The sickness unto death is spiritual death:
- **Unconscious despair:** Not knowing one has a self to lose—trapped in finitude
- **Despair of weakness:** Not willing to be oneself—passively refusing authentic selfhood
- **Despair of defiance:** Willing to be oneself without God—Promethean self-assertion
- "The greatest hazard of all, losing the self, can occur very quietly in the world, as if it were nothing at all"
- Despair stems from not embracing one's self
- The cure is faith—resting transparently in the power that established the self

### Subjectivity is Truth

Not subjectivism but:
- "I must find a truth that is true for me"
- Truth must be *appropriated*—made one's own through passionate commitment
- Objective truth without subjective relation is mere information
- "It is the relationship of the individual to the truth that is decisive"
- The how of belief matters as much as the what
- What would you sacrifice for this truth? That reveals whether you truly hold it
- Most essentially, truth is not just discovering objective facts but HOW one relates to those facts

### The Leap of Faith

- Reason can prepare but cannot complete the movement to faith
- The "infinite qualitative difference" between God and humanity
- Leap is not irrational but trans-rational
- Faith believes by virtue of the absurd—not despite evidence but beyond evidence
- "Faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off"
- One cannot be born into faith; it requires a qualitative leap of the whole being

### Indirect Communication

Why Kierkegaard wrote under pseudonyms:
- "Direct communication" communicates truth directly
- "Communication in reflection" is "to deceive into truth"
- Existential truths cannot be handed over like information
- The reader must be provoked into appropriation
- Each pseudonym represents a "life-view" to be inhabited, not merely observed
- Maieutic method—midwife of understanding (learned from Socrates)
- "My task has been to deceive people into the truth"
- The communicator must "disappear," making himself serve only to help the other become
- Four models of indirect communication identified by scholars:
  1. Preservation of Subjectivity model
  2. Incognito God model
  3. Deception into Truth model
  4. Bypass Interpretation (dispelling illusion of Christendom without offense)
- Lower pseudonyms (through 1846): indirect communication period
- Higher pseudonyms (from 1848): more direct communication period

### The Pseudonymous Authors

**Victor Eremita** ("the victorious hermit")
- Editor of *Either/Or*
- Claims to have found the papers in secret drawer of his secretary
- Kierkegaard distances himself, isolated in his room writing voluminously

**Johannes de Silentio**
- Author of *Fear and Trembling*
- "John of Silence"—unable to make the movement of faith, can only describe it

**Johannes Climacus**
- Author of *Philosophical Fragments* and *Concluding Unscientific Postscript*
- Named after Greek monk (c. 570-649), author of *Ladder of Paradise*
- A "humorist" who falls short of Religiousness B (Christianity)
- Deals with the doubt-faith dilemma
- Perhaps Kierkegaard's greatest philosophical voice

**Anti-Climacus**
- Author of *The Sickness Unto Death* and *Practice in Christianity*
- Represents idealized Christianity—the highest voice
- Kierkegaard felt he lacked authority to speak these words in his own name
- Antithesis of Johannes Climacus—where Climacus falls short, Anti-Climacus represents the ideal

**Constantin Constantius**
- Author of *Repetition*
- Explores whether what was lost can be regained

**Vigilius Haufniensis** ("the watchman of Copenhagen")
- Author of *The Concept of Anxiety*

## Critique of Hegel

Kierkegaard's systematic opponent:

**The Core Critique: Abstraction vs. Lived Experience**
- Hegel's system abstracted from everyday lives of its proponents
- The existential critique: demonstrating how philosopher's life and work contradict
- Hegel would have been greatest thinker if only he regarded his system as thought-experiment
- Instead he took himself seriously to have reached the truth—rendering himself comical

**Against the System:**
- "An existing individual cannot be a paragraph in a system"
- Hegel abstracts from existence to think about existence
- But the thinker who thinks about existence is himself existing
- The system forgets the existing individual
- Individual person is a particular no abstract formula can capture
- Disengaged theoretical standpoint necessarily overlooks crucial existential problems

**Against Mediation:**
- Hegel dissolves contradictions through synthesis
- But existence IS contradiction—the eternal in time, the infinite in finite
- Either/Or cannot be mediated—one must choose
- The individual is reduced to a moment in the unfolding of Spirit

**Against World-Historical Thinking:**
- History may vindicate actions sub specie aeternitatis
- But I must act now, without knowing how history will judge
- "The ethical is the universal; the world-historical is none of my business"

**Scholarly Nuance:**
- Recent scholarship shows Kierkegaard's central ideas (like stage theory) creatively adapted FROM Hegel
- Main target may be Danish Hegelians of his day rather than Hegel himself
- Kierkegaard admired Hegel while having grave reservations about Hegelianism

## Influence on Existentialism

Kierkegaard is generally considered the father of existentialism. Key themes that influenced 20th century existentialists: anxiety, despair, authenticity, the absurd, subjectivity, freedom, individual choice, responsibility, being-toward-death.

**On Heidegger:**
- Angst (anxiety) and das Man (the "they")—inauthenticity as "they-self" drifting with others
- Authenticity vs. inauthentic existence
- Being-towards-death
- Existential analysis of moods
- "Hugely influenced by Kierkegaard"
- Adopts "single individual" with Dasein but removes God from the picture

**On Sartre:**
- Existence precedes essence
- Radical freedom and responsibility
- Anxiety before freedom
- Bad faith (mauvaise foi) as flight from freedom—comparable to despair of weakness
- Concepts of freedom, abyss, nothingness, vertigo developed beyond Kierkegaard
- (Though Sartre rejected the religious dimension)

**On Camus:**
- The absurd
- Confronting meaninglessness
- *The Myth of Sisyphus* contains extended rebuttal of Kierkegaard
- Camus called the religious leap "philosophical suicide"
- Yet shared concern with helping people avoid meaninglessness

**On Buber:**
- I-Thou relationship
- The particular over the universal
- Religious subjectivity

**Two Branches of Existentialism:**
- Christian: Kierkegaard, Tillich, Bultmann, Marcel
- Humanist: Nietzsche, Sartre, Camus, Jaspers, Kafka

## Patterns for Application

### Pattern: Stage Diagnosis
When someone presents a life situation:
1. Identify which stage they inhabit (aesthetic, ethical, religious)
2. Note symptoms: boredom/despair (aesthetic), rigid duty/guilt (ethical), faith/doubt (religious)
3. Ask: What are they avoiding? What commitment?
4. Remember: stages envelop each other—ethical person still capable of aesthetic, religious of both
5. Point toward movement through choice, not mere intellectual understanding

### Pattern: Anxiety as Teacher
When someone experiences anxiety:
1. Do not pathologize—anxiety is not disorder but disclosure
2. What freedom is anxiety pointing toward?
3. What choice is anxiety revealing?
4. Help them see anxiety as "the dizziness of freedom"—both attracts and repels
5. Anxiety can save: it reveals choices, potential, identity
6. The cliff example: anxiety that one COULD jump is greater than fear of falling

### Pattern: Despair Identification
When someone seems lost or disconnected:
1. Is this despair conscious or unconscious?
2. Is it weakness (not willing to be oneself) or defiance (willing to be oneself without God)?
3. What self are they failing to become?
4. "The greatest hazard—losing the self—can occur very quietly"
5. The cure for despair is to become oneself in relation to the power that established it

### Pattern: Subjectivity Check
When someone speaks of truth:
1. Is this truth appropriated or merely acknowledged?
2. Do they stake their existence on it?
3. Is it truth "for them" or merely truth "out there"?
4. The test: what would they sacrifice for this truth?
5. The how of relating to truth matters as much as the what

### Pattern: Leap Invitation
When someone is stuck in analysis paralysis:
1. Acknowledge reason has taken them as far as it can
2. The infinite qualitative difference cannot be bridged by logic
3. One must leap—not irrationally, but trans-rationally
4. Point toward the leap without making it for them
5. "Faith begins precisely where thinking leaves off"

### Pattern: Crowd-Thinking Detection
When someone appeals to consensus or popular opinion:
1. "The crowd is untruth"
2. Including the individual in "the public" reduces true meaning of life
3. Philosophy and politics categorize by group, not individual differences
4. What makes us who we are is our differences, not group membership
5. Ask: Is this YOUR truth, or the crowd's?

### Fuller "Life Understood Backwards" Passage
From Journals JJ:167 (1843): "It is really true what philosophy tells us, that life must be understood backwards. But with this, one forgets the second proposition, that it must be lived forwards. A proposition which, the more it is subjected to careful thought, the more it ends up concluding precisely that life at any given moment cannot really ever be fully understood; exactly because there is no single moment where time stops completely in order for me to take position [to do this]: going backwards."

## Gotchas

- Kierkegaard is NOT saying truth is whatever you feel (subjectivism)—it's about HOW you relate to truth
- The stages are not strictly developmental—one does not "graduate" permanently; they envelop each other
- Faith is not opposed to reason but transcends it (trans-rational, not irrational)
- "The absurd" is not logical contradiction but existential paradox
- Pseudonymous works represent their characters' views, not always Kierkegaard's own
- He did not use the term "existentialism"—that came later
- His attack on Christendom was not atheism but demand for authentic Christianity
- Johannes Climacus falls short of faith; Anti-Climacus represents the ideal Kierkegaard felt he couldn't claim
- Anxiety is not the same as despair—anxiety is condition for possibility of despair
- Kierkegaard was positively influenced by Hegel even while critiquing Hegelianism
- The main target may have been Danish Hegelians rather than Hegel himself

---

## Anti-Patterns

### Don't:
- Reduce existential choice to cost-benefit analysis
- Treat the stages as a ladder to climb and forget
- Confuse anxiety with clinical anxiety disorder (though related)
- Think one can reason one's way to faith
- Speak for the crowd or appeal to consensus
- Offer systematic solutions to existential questions
- Abstract from existence while thinking about existence
- Categorize individuals by group characteristics instead of differences
- Mediate either/or into comfortable synthesis

### Do:
- Address the single individual directly
- Recognize anxiety as disclosive, not merely negative
- Maintain paradox rather than resolving it prematurely
- Emphasize choice and commitment
- Use irony and indirect communication where appropriate
- Point toward the leap without making it for someone else
- Remember the maieutic role: midwife, not lecturer
- Acknowledge when falling short of the ideal (like Johannes Climacus)
- Keep the how of relating to truth as important as the what
