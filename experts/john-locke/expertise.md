## Extended Biography

### Early Life and Civil War Context (1632-1652)

John Locke was born during the English Civil War to Puritan parents in Wrington, Somerset. His father, also named John Locke, was a country lawyer and small landowner who served as a cavalry captain for Parliament under Colonel Alexander Popham. Young Locke witnessed the tumult of civil war, the execution of Charles I in 1649, the Protectorate under Cromwell, and the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 - experiences that shaped his lifelong concern with the proper foundations of political authority.

Through his father's connection to Colonel Popham, Locke secured admission to Westminster School in 1647, then the leading school in England. It was here that he received a classical education and developed the habits of systematic study that would characterize his later work.

### Oxford Years and Dissatisfaction with Scholasticism (1652-1666)

From Westminster, Locke was elected in May 1652 to a Studentship (fellowship) at Christ Church, Oxford, conditionally tenable for life. He pursued the traditional curriculum centered on classical languages, rhetoric, logic, and metaphysics but found the Scholastic approach unsatisfying and irrelevant to the new scientific discoveries of his time.

At Oxford, Locke:
- Took his B.A. (1656) and M.A. (1658)
- Served as Greek Lecturer, Rhetoric Lecturer, and Censor of Moral Philosophy
- Became Tutor in 1661
- Earned a Bachelor of Medicine degree in 1674
- Grew increasingly interested in the new experimental philosophy

Locke found greater intellectual stimulation outside the formal curriculum. He became associated with the circle of Robert Boyle, the chemist who articulated the distinction between primary and secondary qualities that Locke would later adopt. Through Boyle and others, Locke imbibed the methods of the early Royal Society and the new "corpuscular philosophy" that sought to explain natural phenomena through matter in motion.

### The Shaftesbury Years (1666-1683)

Locke's life changed dramatically in 1666 when he met Anthony Ashley Cooper (later the 1st Earl of Shaftesbury) at Oxford. The meeting was occasioned by Locke's medical expertise - he would later successfully supervise a dangerous surgery on Shaftesbury's liver abscess, inserting a silver drainage tube that Shaftesbury wore for the rest of his life.

In 1667, Locke joined Shaftesbury's London household as personal physician, secretary, and political advisor. As Shaftesbury's influence grew, so did Locke's responsibilities:
- He became Secretary of Presentations (ecclesiastical patronage)
- He helped draft the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina (1669)
- He served as Secretary to the Lords Proprietors of Carolina
- He advised on trade policy and colonial administration

Shaftesbury was one of the founders of the Whig party, which advocated constitutional monarchy against the absolutist tendencies of the Crown. This political education profoundly shaped Locke's political philosophy. When Shaftesbury became Lord Chancellor in 1672, Locke's influence was at its height.

### Exile in Holland (1683-1689)

Shaftesbury's opposition to Catholic succession and royal absolutism led to his fall from power. In 1682, he fled to Holland, dying there in January 1683. Locke remained in England but under increasing suspicion.

After the Rye House Plot of 1683 (a failed conspiracy to assassinate Charles II and his brother James), Locke's position became untenable. Though there is little evidence of his direct involvement, his associations made him a target. In September 1683, he fled to Holland, where he would remain for nearly six years.

During his exile:
- He lived under aliases, including "Dr. Van Linden," to evade English agents
- In 1684, Charles II ordered Christ Church to revoke his Studentship
- He immersed himself in the intellectual climate of the Dutch Republic
- He interacted with exiled Englishmen and Dutch intellectuals
- He completed *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding* and published a 50-page abstract in French (1688)
- He drafted the *Two Treatises of Government*
- He wrote *A Letter Concerning Toleration* in Latin (1685)

The Dutch Republic, with its relative religious tolerance and vibrant intellectual life, provided an ideal environment for Locke to refine his ideas about liberty, toleration, and the limits of governmental power.

### The Glorious Revolution and Triumphant Return (1688-1689)

On November 15, 1688, William of Orange, stadholder of the Netherlands, landed at Torbay with an invasion force. King James II's army disintegrated, and by December 23, James had fled to France. This "Glorious Revolution" transformed English politics and vindicated Locke's principles.

Three months later, in February 1689, John Locke returned to England, accompanying Mary II (William's wife and James II's daughter). He seemed to be, as one scholar put it, "enthroned as the philosopher of 1688."

The year 1689 saw the publication of Locke's major works:
- *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (December 1689, dated 1690)
- *Two Treatises of Government* (anonymously)
- *A Letter Concerning Toleration* (anonymously)

Locke published the *Two Treatises* explicitly "to justify the Glorious Revolution" and establish the principles of constitutional monarchy, individual liberty, and religious tolerance.

### Final Years at Oates (1689-1704)

Locke's final years were spent at Oates, the Essex estate of Sir Francis Masham and his wife Damaris (daughter of the Cambridge Platonist Ralph Cudworth). Despite declining health (he suffered from asthma and other ailments), he remained intellectually active.

During this period he published:
- *Some Thoughts Concerning Education* (1693)
- *The Reasonableness of Christianity* (1695)
- Multiple editions of the *Essay* with revisions and expansions
- Additional *Letters Concerning Toleration* responding to critics

He also served on the Board of Trade (1696-1700), advising on colonial and commercial policy, until ill health forced his retirement. John Locke died at Oates on October 28, 1704, while Damaris Masham read psalms to him.

## Core Philosophical Positions

### Epistemology: The Way of Ideas

Locke's *Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (1689) established modern empiricism and remains one of the most influential works in the history of philosophy.

**The Attack on Innate Ideas (Book I)**

Locke's first target is the doctrine of innate ideas - the rationalist claim that certain principles are inscribed in the mind from birth. He attacks both:
- **Speculative innate principles** (e.g., "whatever is, is" and "it is impossible for the same thing to be and not be")
- **Practical innate principles** (moral rules supposedly written on the heart)

His arguments:
- If ideas were truly innate, they would be universal - known to children, "idiots," and peoples of all cultures
- But observation shows these ideas are not universal
- What appears innate was simply learned early and forgotten - the inscription seems native because we cannot remember a time without it
- There is no need for innate ideas: experience can explain all our ideas

"Let us then suppose the mind to be, as we say, white paper, void of all characters, without any ideas: How comes it to be furnished? Whence comes it by that vast store, which the busy and boundless fancy of man has painted on it with an almost endless variety? Whence has it all the materials of reason and knowledge? To this I answer, in one word, from EXPERIENCE."

**The Origin of Ideas (Book II)**

All ideas come from two sources:
- **Sensation**: External experience through the five senses, which provides ideas of qualities like yellow, hot, bitter, sweet
- **Reflection**: Internal experience - the mind observing its own operations, which provides ideas like thinking, willing, doubting, believing

This dual source answers the question of how the blank slate gets written upon.

**Simple and Complex Ideas**

| Simple Ideas | Complex Ideas |
|--------------|---------------|
| Received passively | Actively constructed |
| Cannot be created or destroyed by the mind | Built from simple ideas |
| Examples: red, sweet, round, cold | Examples: beauty, army, universe |
| Atomic building blocks of thought | Compounds of mental activity |

The mind, though passive in receiving simple ideas, has three active powers:
1. **Combining** - joining simple ideas into complex ones
2. **Comparing** - relating ideas to each other
3. **Abstracting** - separating ideas from their particular circumstances

**Primary vs. Secondary Qualities**

Drawing on Boyle's corpuscular philosophy, Locke distinguishes two types of qualities:

| Primary Qualities | Secondary Qualities |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Exist in the object itself | Exist only in our perception |
| Extension, solidity, figure, motion, number | Color, sound, taste, smell, warmth |
| Inseparable from body - divide an object and each part retains them | Variable with the perceiver |
| Our ideas *resemble* the qualities | Our ideas do *not* resemble the powers that cause them |
| Objective | Subjective (though caused by objective primary qualities) |

Secondary qualities are "powers in bodies to produce ideas in us" through the interaction of our sensory apparatus with the object's primary qualities. The redness of an apple is not "in" the apple the way its shape is - rather, the apple has a power (due to its surface texture at the microscopic level) to produce the sensation of red in observers.

**The Extent and Limits of Knowledge (Books III-IV)**

Knowledge, for Locke, is "the perception of the connexion and agreement, or disagreement and repugnancy, of any of our ideas." It comes in three degrees:

1. **Intuitive** (highest) - immediate perception of agreement, as "white is not black"
2. **Demonstrative** - proven through intermediate ideas, as in mathematics
3. **Sensitive** (lowest) - knowledge of particular external objects through the senses

Beyond knowledge lies:
- **Probability** or **opinion** - where we judge based on evidence without certainty
- **Faith** - assent to propositions based on divine revelation

Locke insists we must recognize the limits of human understanding and not claim certainty where only probability is available. "Our business here is not to know all things, but those which concern our conduct."

### Political Philosophy: Government by Consent

The *Two Treatises of Government* (1689) established the foundations of liberal political theory. The First Treatise refutes Sir Robert Filmer's defense of absolute monarchy based on patriarchal authority. The Second Treatise develops Locke's positive account.

**The State of Nature**

Locke's state of nature is fundamentally different from Hobbes's "war of all against all":

| Locke's State of Nature | Hobbes's State of Nature |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| State of perfect freedom | State of absolute liberty |
| State of equality | State of equality |
| Governed by natural law (reason) | No effective law |
| Generally peaceful but inconvenient | "Solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short" |
| Natural rights exist and are knowable | No rights until sovereign creates them |
| Property rights exist before government | No property rights in nature |

"The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions."

The state of nature is inconvenient because each person must enforce natural law individually (the "executive power of the state of nature"). This leads to the problems of:
- Partiality in one's own case
- Lack of a common judge
- Insufficient power to enforce judgments

**The Social Contract**

To remedy these inconveniences, persons consent to form political society:

1. They surrender only the right to enforce natural law (not their natural rights)
2. They establish a common legislature, executive, and judiciary
3. Government is a trust for specific purposes: protecting life, liberty, and property
4. If government violates this trust, authority reverts to the people

Unlike Hobbes's irrevocable transfer of power to an absolute sovereign, Locke's contract is:
- Conditional upon the government fulfilling its trust
- Revocable when the government betrays that trust
- Limited to specific delegated powers

**Natural Rights: Life, Liberty, Property**

Natural rights exist in the state of nature, prior to and independent of government:

- **Life**: The right to preserve oneself; no one may take another's life without forfeiture
- **Liberty**: The freedom to act within the bounds of natural law without asking permission
- **Property**: The right to what one has "mixed" one's labor with

The labor theory of property:
"Though the earth, and all inferior creatures, be common to all men, yet every man has a property in his own person: this no body has any right to but himself. The labour of his body, and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left it in, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property."

But property rights have limits:
- **The spoilage proviso**: One may not accumulate more than one can use before it spoils
- **The sufficiency proviso**: One must leave "enough, and as good" for others
- **Money complicates both provisos**: It does not spoil, enabling unlimited accumulation

**Limited Government and Separation of Powers**

Government power is not absolute but limited by:
- Natural law, which binds even the legislature
- The purposes for which power was delegated
- The requirement that power serve the public good

Locke distinguishes three powers:
1. **Legislative** - the supreme power, but limited and accountable
2. **Executive** - enforces the laws made by the legislature
3. **Federative** - manages foreign relations (usually held with the executive)

**The Right of Revolution**

When government acts against the interests of the people - when "the legislators endeavour to take away and destroy the property of the people, or to reduce them to slavery under arbitrary power" - they "put themselves into a state of war with the people."

At that point:
- Government forfeits its authority
- Power reverts to the people
- The people may establish new government

This doctrine directly influenced the American Declaration of Independence.

### Religious Toleration

*A Letter Concerning Toleration* (written 1685, published 1689) argues for the separation of church and state:

**The Core Argument**

1. The magistrate's power "consists only in outward force"
2. "True and saving religion consists in the inward persuasion of the mind"
3. Therefore, the magistrate cannot produce genuine faith - only hypocrisy
4. The state should concern itself only with "civil interests" - life, liberty, health, property
5. Religion is not among the civil interests the state exists to protect

**Why Persecution Fails**

- You cannot compel belief - only outward conformity
- Forced conformity produces hypocrisy, not genuine faith
- Persecution breeds conflict rather than unity
- No ruler can be certain their religion is the correct one

"It is not the diversity of opinions, which cannot be avoided, but the refusal of toleration to those that are of different opinions, which might have been granted, that has produced all the bustles and wars that have been in the Christian world upon account of religion."

**The Limits of Toleration**

Despite his liberal principles, Locke excluded certain groups:

| Excluded Group | Reason for Exclusion |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Catholics** | Divided loyalty - they owe allegiance to a "foreign prince" (the Pope); their principles threaten civil society |
| **Atheists** | "Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon an atheist" - without fear of divine punishment, their word cannot be trusted |
| **Those whose principles threaten civil order** | Any group whose doctrines undermine the foundations of society |

Modern readers often find these exclusions inconsistent with Locke's stated principles - and indeed, his arguments point toward greater inclusion than he allowed. Some scholars argue he left open the theoretical possibility of tolerating Catholics who adopted tolerant principles and rejected political allegiance to the Pope.

### Personal Identity: The Memory Theory

In the *Essay* (II.xxvii, added in 1694), Locke offered a revolutionary account of personal identity that remains influential and controversial.

**The Question**

What makes a person at time T2 the same person as a person at time T1?

**Locke's Answer**

Personal identity consists not in:
- Identity of substance (the same soul)
- Identity of body (the same physical matter)

But in:
- **Continuity of consciousness** - specifically, memory

"For, since consciousness always accompanies thinking, and it is that which makes every one to be what he calls self, and thereby distinguishes himself from all other thinking things, in this alone consists personal identity, i.e. the sameness of a rational being: and as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past action or thought, so far reaches the identity of that person."

A person is "a thinking intelligent being, that has reason and reflection, and can consider itself as itself, the same thinking thing, in different times and places."

**Moral and Legal Implications**

Locke's theory has practical consequences:
- You are only morally responsible for actions you can remember as your own
- This provides a philosophical basis for the insanity defense
- External judges can only punish the body, but moral accountability follows consciousness

**Famous Objections**

| Objector | Objection |
|----------|-----------|
| **Thomas Reid** | The "Brave Officer" paradox: An old general remembers being a young officer who was flogged as a boy, but doesn't remember the flogging. By Locke's criteria, the general is and is not identical with the boy. |
| **Joseph Butler** | Circularity: Memory presupposes personal identity (I remember *my* experiences), so memory cannot constitute personal identity without circular reasoning. |
| **General concern** | Sleep, amnesia, and intoxication interrupt consciousness, raising puzzles about identity and responsibility during such interruptions. |

Despite these objections, Locke's insight that personal identity is a matter of psychological rather than substantial continuity remains foundational to contemporary discussions.

## Influence on American Founding

Locke's influence on the American founding was profound, direct, and acknowledged by the Founders themselves.

### Direct Influence on Key Documents

| Locke's Language | American Equivalent |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| "Life, liberty, and property" | "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" (Declaration) |
| "All men are by nature equal" | "All men are created equal" |
| Consent of the governed | "Governments... deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed" |
| Right of revolution | "It is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government" |
| Natural rights preexist government | "Endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights" |
| Government as trust | Constitution as limited grant of enumerated powers |

### Jefferson's Acknowledgment

In a letter of May 8, 1825, about his sources for the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson cited Locke and Algernon Sidney among his primary influences. In an 1790 letter to a law student, he recommended: "Locke's little book on Government is perfect as far as it goes."

Jefferson substituted "pursuit of happiness" for "property" - possibly drawing on Locke's association of happiness with proper use of liberty, or on the broader natural rights tradition. But the Lockean structure is unmistakable.

### The First Continental Congress (1774)

The Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress (1774) quotes Locke almost verbatim, resolving that colonists "are entitled to life, liberty and property."

### Madison and Constitutional Design

James Madison's constitutional theory drew heavily on Lockean principles:
- Government as a grant of limited, enumerated powers
- Separation of powers (though Madison developed this beyond Locke)
- Rights as pre-political, not grants from government
- The people as the ultimate source of political authority

## Relationships and Contrasts

### Locke vs. Rationalists (Descartes, Leibniz, Spinoza)

| Issue | Locke (Empiricist) | Rationalists |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Source of knowledge | Experience (sensation/reflection) | Reason and innate ideas |
| Innate ideas | None - mind is blank slate | The mind contains innate principles |
| Certainty | Limited to relations of ideas | Extends to substantial truths about reality |
| Method | Observation, careful analysis of experience | Deduction from clear and distinct ideas |
| Knowledge of external world | Through sensation (sensitive knowledge) | Through reason alone |

The debate between empiricism and rationalism framed much of 18th-century philosophy, culminating in Kant's attempted synthesis.

### Locke vs. Hobbes: The Great Contrast

Though both used social contract theory, their conclusions were radically opposed:

| Issue | Locke | Hobbes |
|-------|-------|--------|
| Human nature | Naturally reasonable, social, capable of morality | Naturally competitive, violent, egoistic |
| State of nature | Peaceful but inconvenient; governed by natural law | "War of all against all"; "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short" |
| Natural rights | Exist prior to government, discoverable by reason | No rights until sovereign creates them |
| Property | Exists in state of nature through labor | No property without sovereign power |
| Source of moral law | Natural reason, accessible to all | Sovereign command |
| Government purpose | Protect pre-existing rights | Create order from chaos |
| Sovereign power | Limited, conditional, revocable | Absolute, unconditional, irrevocable |
| Revolution | A right when government betrays trust | Never legitimate |
| Preferred regime | Constitutional monarchy, mixed government | Absolute monarchy |

The contrast reflects their different historical contexts: Hobbes wrote during the chaos of the English Civil War, fearing anarchy above all; Locke wrote in response to Stuart absolutism, fearing tyranny.

### Locke and the Enlightenment

Locke's influence radiated throughout the 18th-century Enlightenment:

| Thinker | Locke's Influence |
|---------|------------------|
| **Voltaire** | Introduced Locke to France in *Letters on England*; called him "the Hercules of metaphysics who set limits to the human mind" |
| **Montesquieu** | Developed Locke's separation of powers into the modern doctrine of checks and balances |
| **Rousseau** | Built on (and transformed) social contract theory, though his "general will" diverged from Lockean individualism |
| **Hume** | Extended empiricism more radically, reaching skeptical conclusions Locke avoided |
| **Kant** | Began from the empiricist challenge, seeking to determine what knowledge was possible given that origin |
| **The French Revolution** | Invoked Lockean natural rights in the Declaration of the Rights of Man (1789) |
| **American Founders** | Jefferson, Madison, Adams, and others directly cited and applied Lockean principles |

### Later Critiques

| Critic | Critique |
|--------|----------|
| **Berkeley** | Argued the primary/secondary distinction is spurious - all qualities are ideas in minds; matter does not exist |
| **Hume** | Extended empiricism to undermine causation, self, and induction - more radical than Locke intended |
| **Kant** | Argued both primary and secondary qualities are subjective; the thing-in-itself is unknowable |
| **Marx** | Criticized Lockean property rights as ideological justification for bourgeois appropriation |
| **Filmer (refuted by Locke)** | Defended absolute monarchy from patriarchal authority |

---

## Application Domains

| Domain | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Political Philosophy** | Foundation for liberal democracy, constitutional government, limited state |
| **Epistemology** | Empiricist methodology, critique of innate ideas, limits of knowledge |
| **Education** | Child development theory, experiential learning, *Some Thoughts Concerning Education* |
| **Religious Studies** | Toleration, separation of church and state, limits of civil authority over conscience |
| **Property Theory** | Labor theory of property, provisos limiting accumulation, commons |
| **Human Rights** | Natural rights framework, universal human dignity, inalienable rights |
| **Constitutional Law** | Consent, limited government, separation of powers, right of revolution |
| **Psychology** | Foundations of associationist psychology, personal identity, consciousness |
| **Philosophy of Mind** | Primary/secondary qualities, personal identity, the nature of ideas |

---

## Common Misunderstandings

| Misconception | Correction |
|---------------|------------|
| "Tabula rasa means humans have no innate capacities" | Locke denied innate *ideas*, not innate *capacities*. The mind has native powers to combine, compare, and abstract ideas. We are born with the faculties of perception and reasoning, just not with pre-inscribed content. |
| "Locke's state of nature is like Hobbes's" | Locke's state of nature is fundamentally peaceful, governed by natural law knowable through reason. It is inconvenient, not chaotic. People leave it to better protect their rights, not to escape war of all against all. |
| "Locke advocated unlimited property accumulation" | Locke placed limits on acquisition: the "spoilage" proviso (don't take more than you can use) and the sufficiency proviso (leave "enough and as good" for others). Money complicates these limits but does not eliminate them as moral constraints. |
| "Toleration meant universal religious freedom" | Locke excluded Catholics (foreign allegiance) and atheists (unreliable oaths) from toleration - though his principles pointed toward greater inclusion than he explicitly allowed. |
| "Locke's memory theory means you are not the same person if you forget something" | Locke's view is more nuanced - personal identity extends as far as consciousness *can* extend, and consciousness may recover past actions even if not currently remembering them. The theory concerns the reach of moral responsibility, not moment-to-moment identity. |
| "Locke was a democrat" | Locke supported constitutional government and the right of the majority, but he was not a democrat in the modern sense. He supported property qualifications for voting and did not advocate universal suffrage. |

## Integration Notes

When working with other experts:

- **Complements Kant** - Kant's critical philosophy began from the empiricist challenge Locke posed; together they frame the modern epistemological debate between what comes from experience and what the mind contributes

- **Contrasts with Hobbes** - Both use social contract theory but reach opposite conclusions about sovereign power, the state of nature, and the right of revolution

- **Foundation for American founders** - Jefferson, Madison, and Franklin drew directly on Lockean principles; the Declaration of Independence is essentially a Lockean document

- **Dialogue with rationalists** - Locke's critique of innate ideas defined empiricism against Descartes and Leibniz; the debate structured Enlightenment philosophy

- **Precursor to Hume** - Hume extended Locke's empiricism more radically, reaching skeptical conclusions Locke would not have endorsed

- **Influence on Berkeley** - Berkeley used Locke's arguments against the primary/secondary distinction, arguing all qualities are ideas

- **Compare with Rousseau** - Both used social contract theory, but Rousseau's "general will" and romantic naturalism diverged from Lockean individualism
