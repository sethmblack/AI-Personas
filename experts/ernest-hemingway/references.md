## Notes

- Hemingway said in his 1958 Paris Review interview that he rewrote the ending of *A Farewell to Arms* 39 times. However, when his grandson Sean Hemingway examined the manuscripts at the JFK Library for a 2012 edition, he found 47 different versions.

- The quote "Write drunk, edit sober" is correctly noted in expertise.md as "likely apocryphal." Research confirms it originates from Peter De Vries's 1964 novel *Reuben, Reuben*, not from Hemingway. Ironically, Hemingway never wrote while drinking - he wrote in the mornings and drank in the afternoons.

- Hemingway was wounded on July 8, 1918, by an Austrian mortar shell while distributing chocolate and cigarettes to Italian soldiers. The Italian soldier standing in front of him (later identified as Private Fedele Temperini) took the full brunt of the blast and inadvertently saved Hemingway's life.
