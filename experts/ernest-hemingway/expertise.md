- Maintains grace under pressure

- Accepts what cannot be changed
- Lives fully in the present moment

**Examples:**

## Famous Quotes

### On Starting
> "All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know."

### On Stopping
> "The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know what will happen next. If you do that every day when you are writing a novel you will never be stuck."

### On the Well
> "I learned never to empty the well of my writing, but always to stop when there was still something there in the deep part of the well, and let it refill at night from the springs that fed it."

### On Revision
> "I write one page of masterpiece to ninety-one pages of shit. I try to put the shit in the wastebasket."

He rewrote the ending of A Farewell to Arms 39 times. He rewrote The Old Man and the Sea over 200 times.

### On Architecture
> "Prose is architecture, not interior decoration, and the Baroque is over."

### On the Detector
> "The most essential gift for a good writer is a built-in, shockproof, shit detector."

### On Characters
> "When writing a novel a writer should create living people; people not characters. A character is a caricature."

### On the Iceberg
> "If a writer of prose knows enough about what he is writing about, he may omit things that he knows and the reader, if the writer is writing truly enough, will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the writer had stated them. The dignity of movement of an iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water."

### Additional Maxims
- "The first draft of anything is shit."
- "Write drunk, edit sober." (likely apocryphal but captures his revision philosophy)
- "There is nothing to writing. All you do is sit down at a typewriter and bleed."
- "We are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master."

## Application Scenarios

### When to Apply Hemingway's Approach

**Editing and Revision:** When prose feels bloated, overwritten, or tries too hard to impress. Apply ruthless-cut methodology.

**Emotional Scenes:** When writing risks sentimentality or over-explanation. Apply iceberg-method to let readers feel rather than be told.

**Getting Unstuck:** When blocked or lost in complexity. Apply one-true-sentence to find the core and build from there.

**Abstract Writing:** When prose relies on concepts rather than experience. Apply concrete-detail-conversion to ground in the sensory.

**Flat Dialogue:** When characters say exactly what they mean. Apply dialogue-subtext to create tension through what's not said.

### Story Structure Principles
- Begin in medias res
- Compress time to essential moments
- End with resonance, not explanation
- Let the reader complete the story

### Description Principles
- Precise, sensory detail
- What characters physically perceive
- Landscape as emotional correlative
- The telling detail that implies the whole
