### 1. iceberg-method

**Score: 48/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear 4-step process: know everything, write surface, omit what you know, trust the reader |

| Valuable | 9 | Dramatically improves emotional impact by eliminating heavy-handedness |

**Source Pattern:** The Iceberg Theory / Theory of Omission
**Purpose:** Transform explicit, telling prose into implicit, showing prose by strategically omitting what the writer knows.
**Trigger:** "Apply the iceberg method" or "This tells instead of shows" or "Make this more subtle"
**Inputs:** Prose that over-explains, tells emotion, or lacks subtext
**Outputs:** Revised prose with strategic omissions that readers feel but don't see stated

### 2. ruthless-cut

| Scoped | 10 | Single responsibility: eliminating unnecessary words |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to any prose - business, fiction, marketing, emails, documentation |
| Valuable | 8 | Significant improvement to clarity and impact |

**Source Pattern:** Writing Process / Revision

### 3. one-true-sentence

**Score: 44/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Process: identify the core truth, state it simply, build from there |
| Invocable | 9 | "What's the one true sentence?" or "Help me find the core" |
| Scoped | 10 | Single responsibility: finding the essential truth of a piece |
| Reusable | 9 | Works for starting any writing, unsticking blocked work, finding thesis |
| Valuable | 8 | Helps overcome writer's block and find direction |

**Source Pattern:** On Starting / One True Sentence
**Purpose:** Find the truest, most essential sentence that captures what you're trying to say, then build from it.
**Trigger:** "What's the one true sentence?" or "I'm stuck, help me start" or "What am I really trying to say?"
**Inputs:** Topic, situation, or stuck draft
**Outputs:** The one true sentence and guidance on building from it

### 4. concrete-detail-conversion

**Score: 43/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|

**Source Pattern:** Concrete Specificity
**Purpose:** Replace abstract language with concrete, sensory details that readers can perceive.

**Inputs:** Prose with abstract language, vague descriptions, or telling instead of showing
**Outputs:** Revised prose with concrete nouns, precise verbs, and sensory details

---

### 5. dialogue-subtext

**Score: 41/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Process: identify what's not said, use repetition, add evasion, cut attribution |
| Invocable | 8 | "Add subtext to this dialogue" or "Make the dialogue do more work" |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: improving dialogue through subtext |
| Reusable | 7 | Primarily fiction and screenwriting, some business applications |
| Valuable | 9 | Transforms flat dialogue into revealing exchange |

**Source Pattern:** Dialogue Craft
**Purpose:** Transform on-the-nose dialogue into exchanges where what's not said matters more than what is.
**Trigger:** "Add subtext to this dialogue" or "This dialogue is too on-the-nose"
**Inputs:** Dialogue that states too directly what characters think or feel
**Outputs:** Revised dialogue with strategic omissions, repetition, and subtext

---

## MEDIUM Priority (30-39 points)

### 6. stop-while-good

**Score: 36/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Principle rather than step-by-step process |
| Invocable | 6 | "How do I maintain writing momentum?" - less natural trigger |
| Scoped | 8 | Single responsibility: managing writing sessions |
| Reusable | 7 | Applies to long-form writing projects |
| Valuable | 8 | Prevents burnout and writer's block |

**Source Pattern:** Writing Process / The Well
**Purpose:** Guide writers on when and how to stop writing sessions to maintain momentum.
**Trigger:** "How do I avoid writer's block?" or "Should I stop here?"
**Inputs:** Current writing status, what's known about what comes next
**Outputs:** Recommendation on stopping point and preparation for next session

---

## LOW Priority (Below 30 points)

### 7. shit-detector

**Score: 29/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 5 | More instinct than process - difficult to systematize |
| Invocable | 7 | "Is this fake?" or "Run the shit detector" |
| Scoped | 5 | Overlaps significantly with other editing skills |
| Reusable | 7 | Applies broadly but overlaps with iceberg and ruthless-cut |
| Valuable | 5 | Value captured by other skills |

**Reason for LOW:** The "shit detector" is more of an instinct than a discrete skill. Its functions are better served by iceberg-method (for emotional fakery), ruthless-cut (for overwrought prose), and one-true-sentence (for finding authenticity).
