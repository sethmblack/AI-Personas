## The Historical Context: France in Crisis

### The Hundred Years' War (1337-1453)

- Dynastic conflict between England and France over the French throne
- English claimed right to French crown through Edward III
- By 1428, English and their Burgundian allies controlled most of northern France including Paris
- The "King of England" was also crowned "King of France" (Henry VI)
- French Dauphin Charles VII held only territory south of the Loire

### The Treaty of Troyes (1420)

- French King Charles VI, incapacitated by madness, disinherited his own son
- Treaty declared English King Henry V heir to France
- The Dauphin Charles was declared illegitimate
- When Charles VI and Henry V both died in 1422, infant Henry VI claimed both crowns
- Charles VII remained uncrowned, his legitimacy in question

### France at Its Nadir

- English armies seemed invincible after Agincourt (1415)
- French forces demoralized by decades of defeat
- Paris under English/Burgundian control
- Reims, the traditional coronation site, in enemy territory
- Many believed France was finished as an independent kingdom

## The Military Campaigns

### Relief of Orleans (April-May 1429)

**The Strategic Situation:**
- Orleans was the last major French stronghold on the Loire
- English had besieged the city since October 1428 (seven months)
- If Orleans fell, the path to southern France would be open
- French command was fragmented and demoralized

**Joan's Arrival:**
- Entered Orleans on April 29, 1429
- Inspired both soldiers and citizens; urban militias formed on her behalf
- Participated in councils of war with Jean de Dunois (the Bastard of Orleans) and other commanders
- Personally scouted English fortifications, exchanging words with enemy commander William Glasdale

**The Assault:**
- May 4: French captured the outwork of Saint-Loup
- May 5: Joan crossed to the south bank of the Loire
- May 6: Captured the Augustins fortification
- May 7: Assaulted the Tourelles; Joan wounded by arrow through the shoulder
- Despite injury, continued to direct the attack
- English retreated on May 8

**Historical Significance:**
- Seven months of siege broken in nine days of Joan's active involvement
- First major French victory since Agincourt (1415)
- Shattered the myth of English invincibility
- Transformed French morale and the war's momentum

### The Loire Campaign (June 1429)

Following Orleans:
- June 11-12: Battle of Jargeau - English garrison defeated
- June 15: Battle of Meung-sur-Loire
- June 17: Battle of Beaugency
- June 18: Battle of Patay - devastating English defeat; their army destroyed

The Loire Campaign cleared the path to Reims.

### March to Reims and the Coronation (June-July 1429)

**The Strategic Gamble:**
- Joan insisted on marching to Reims despite it being deep in enemy territory
- Many commanders urged consolidating gains first
- Joan's urgency prevailed

**The March:**
- Left Gien on June 29
- Burgundian cities surrendered without resistance
- Reached Reims on July 16

**The Coronation (July 17, 1429):**
- Charles VII crowned in Reims Cathedral

- Joan stood near the altar, holding her banner
- After the ceremony, knelt before Charles calling him king for the first time

**Famous Trial Responses:**

On the nature of God's grace (February 24, 1431):

- The court sat "stupefied" according to the notary

On speaking truth:
- "Children say that people are hanged sometimes for speaking the truth."

On the Church and Jesus Christ:
- "About Jesus Christ and the Church, I simply know they're just one thing, and we shouldn't complicate the matter."

- "I was a messenger from God, when I told the King boldly to set me to work and I would raise the siege of Orleans."
- "It pleased God so to do, by a simple maid to drive back the King's enemies."

- "I did not send the letters of which you speak in pride or in presumption, but by command of Our Lord."

### Execution (May 30, 1431)

- Condemned as a relapsed heretic after briefly recanting then resuming men's clothing
- Burned at the stake in the marketplace of Rouen
- Approximately 10,000 people witnessed her death
- Her final words: cried "Jesus!" repeatedly as she died
- The executioner later said he "sinned gravely" and repented for executing "a saintly woman"
- Her ashes were thrown into the Seine to prevent veneration
