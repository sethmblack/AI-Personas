## HIGH Priority

### 1. motivation-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** Motivation Analysis / Psychological Insights
**Purpose:** Uncover the layered motivations driving a person's behavior—surface want, deep want, and underlying fear.
**Trigger:** "Why is this person really doing this?" or "What's really driving them?" or "Diagnose their motivation"
**Inputs:** Person's observable behavior, stated reasons, context of situation
**Outputs:** Three-layer analysis (surface want, deep want, fear), explanation of how these layers interact, prediction of future behavior based on true motivation
**Reasoning:** This is Shakespeare's core psychological insight—characters have layered motivations. Highly practical for understanding colleagues, negotiating, managing relationships. Clear three-part structure makes it actionable.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 3 explicit layers to identify with clear outputs
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases exist
- Scoped: YES - one responsibility (motivation analysis)
- Reusable: YES - applies to workplace, relationships, negotiations, conflict
- Valuable: YES - transforms confusion about behavior into understanding

**Score: 45/50**

### 2. dramatic-situation-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Signature Analytical Framework / Five-Act Structure
**Purpose:** Analyze any situation through Shakespeare's dramatic lens to reveal conflict, characters, stakes, and possible resolutions.
**Trigger:** "What's the drama here?" or "Analyze this situation dramatically" or "Give me Shakespeare's take"
**Inputs:** Description of situation, parties involved, apparent conflict or decision point
**Outputs:** Structured analysis covering: protagonist, wants, obstacles (external/internal), foils, turning point, and what resolution reveals
**Reasoning:** Shakespeare's core methodology for understanding human situations. The six-question framework provides rigorous structure. Applicable to business conflicts, family dynamics, career decisions—anywhere humans collide.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 6 explicit questions with clear outputs
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases exist
- Scoped: YES - one responsibility (dramatic situation analysis)
- Reusable: YES - applies to any conflict or complex situation
- Valuable: YES - reveals hidden structure in confusing situations

**Score: 47/50**

### 3. character-foil-construction

**Source Pattern:** Character Foils
**Purpose:** Illuminate a person, decision, or option by constructing a deliberate contrast that reveals hidden qualities.
**Trigger:** "Who/what is the foil here?" or "What contrast would be revealing?" or "Show me through comparison"
**Inputs:** The character, decision, or option to understand; context for finding meaningful contrast
**Outputs:** Identification of revealing foil, explanation of what the contrast exposes, insights about both elements through juxtaposition
**Reasoning:** Shakespeare's technique of illumination through contrast. Clear methodology: find a parallel case with different outcome, explain what the difference reveals. Useful for decision-making, understanding people, strategic analysis.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - identify parallel, note difference, explain revelation
- Invocable: YES - distinctive trigger phrases
- Scoped: YES - single technique (contrastive illumination)
- Reusable: YES - decisions, people, strategies, options
- Valuable: YES - reveals what direct analysis misses

**Score: 42/50**

### 4. manipulation-detection

**Source Pattern:** How Manipulation Works (Iago's Method / The Witches' Method)
**Purpose:** Identify manipulation tactics in a situation by mapping against Shakespeare's detailed patterns.
**Trigger:** "Am I being manipulated?" or "What manipulation is happening here?" or "Detect manipulation"
**Inputs:** Description of concerning interaction or pattern, statements made, changes in perception
**Outputs:** Analysis against Iago's method (trust, doubt, imagination, evidence, isolation) or Witches' method (ambiguity, permission, apparent freedom), specific tactics identified, recommendations for response
**Reasoning:** Shakespeare mapped psychological manipulation with precision that remains applicable today. Two distinct patterns (direct manipulation and prophetic manipulation) cover major categories. Saves significant cost by early detection.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - two clear frameworks with 5-6 steps each
- Invocable: YES - triggered by suspicion of manipulation
- Scoped: YES - manipulation detection and analysis
- Reusable: YES - workplace, relationships, sales, negotiations
- Valuable: YES - prevents costly manipulation damage

**Score: 44/50**

### 5. soliloquy-construction

**Source Pattern:** The Soliloquy
**Purpose:** Help someone articulate their unspoken internal dialogue—the thoughts and feelings they cannot or will not express publicly.
**Trigger:** "What am I really thinking?" or "Write my soliloquy" or "What's the internal monologue here?"
**Inputs:** Situation the person is facing, their public position, hints about private feelings
**Outputs:** A first-person internal monologue capturing the private truth, structured as decision soliloquy, confession soliloquy, or reflection soliloquy as appropriate
**Reasoning:** Shakespeare used soliloquy to reveal private truth beneath public performance. Powerful for self-understanding, empathy exercises, therapeutic processing. Clear types (decision, confession, reflection) provide structure.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - choose type, construct internal voice
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases
- Scoped: YES - internal monologue construction
- Reusable: YES - self-understanding, empathy, communication, therapy
- Valuable: YES - surfaces hidden truth that drives action

**Score: 41/50**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 6. persuasion-speech-craft

**Source Pattern:** Famous Speeches / Rhetorical Devices
**Purpose:** Construct a persuasive speech or message using Shakespeare's rhetorical techniques.
**Trigger:** "Help me persuade them" or "Write a speech for this" or "Make this compelling"
**Inputs:** Audience, desired outcome, key message, constraints
**Outputs:** Rhetorically crafted message using appropriate devices (antithesis, anaphora, hendiadys), structured for dramatic impact with clear call to action
**Reasoning:** Shakespeare was a master of persuasive rhetoric. His techniques (Mark Antony's funeral oration, Henry V's St. Crispin's Day speech) remain models. However, this overlaps significantly with general rhetoric skills.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific techniques to apply
- Invocable: YES - triggered by persuasion needs
- Scoped: YES - persuasive communication construction
- Reusable: YES - presentations, negotiations, leadership
- Valuable: MODERATE - powerful but overlaps with rhetoric generally

**Score: 35/50**

### 7. jealousy-trajectory-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Jealousy's Mechanism
**Purpose:** Analyze whether jealousy is distorting perception and predict its trajectory.
**Trigger:** "Is this jealousy?" or "Where is this jealousy heading?" or "Analyze jealousy"
**Inputs:** Description of suspicions, evidence being cited, changes in relationship
**Outputs:** Stage assessment (seed, imagination, evidence, isolation, action), reality check on evidence quality, trajectory prediction, intervention recommendations
**Reasoning:** Shakespeare's five-stage model of jealousy in Othello remains psychologically accurate. Provides clear diagnostic for a specific destructive emotion. However, narrow scope limits general applicability.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 5-stage framework with clear progression
- Invocable: YES - triggered by jealousy situations
- Scoped: YES - jealousy analysis specifically
- Reusable: MODERATE - common but specific emotion
- Valuable: YES within scope - prevents Othello-type disasters

**Score: 36/50**

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Five-Act Structure | Subsumed by dramatic-situation-analysis; more useful as reference than standalone skill |
| Iambic Pentameter | Technical writing craft, not an actionable analytical framework |
| Prose vs. Verse | Contextual judgment for creative writing, not structured workflow |
| Neologisms | Historical reference, no actionable modern workflow |
| Comic Relief | Dramatic technique, not standalone analytical skill |
| Play-Within-the-Play | Specialized theatrical device, limited general application |
| Asides | Subsumed by soliloquy-construction conceptually |
| Ambition's Trajectory | Similar to jealousy-trajectory but less distinct; could be MEDIUM if needed |
| Tragic Flaw Identification | Subsumed by motivation-diagnosis (flaw is relationship of strength to context) |
| Famous Quotes | Reference material, no workflow |
| Appearance vs. Reality | Theme, not actionable framework |
