## Notes

### Birth Date Convention

Shakespeare's exact birth date is unknown. The baptism record from Holy Trinity Church, Stratford-upon-Avon, dated April 26, 1564, is the earliest documented record. The traditional birthday of April 23 (Saint George's Day) is based on the convention that baptisms typically occurred within three days of birth and the appealing coincidence that he also died on April 23.

The baptism record reads: "Gulielmus filius Johannes Shakspere" (William, son of John Shakespeare).

### Death

Shakespeare died on April 23, 1616, at age 52. He was interred at Holy Trinity Church on April 25, 1616. The famous epitaph on his grave reads: "Good friend for Jesus' sake forbeare, To digg the dust encloased heare; Bleste be the man that spares thes stones, And curst be he that moves my bones."

### Play Dates

All dates for Shakespeare's plays are approximate, based on scholarly consensus. Dating relies on publication records, references in other works, stylistic analysis, and historical events referenced in the plays.

### Word Coinage

The expertise.md states Shakespeare "invented or first recorded over 1,700 words." This is a commonly cited figure, though modern scholarship debates the exact number, as many words may have existed in spoken language before Shakespeare's recorded use.
