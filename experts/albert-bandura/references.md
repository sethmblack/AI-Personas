The Bolocan Award is described in sources as "annually awarded to the outstanding student in psychology" at UBC. This is verified by multiple biographical sources.

### "Greatest Living Psychologist"
During his lifetime, Bandura was frequently described as "the greatest living psychologist." This is documented in multiple sources including Stanford University's obituary and the Association for Psychological Science.
