## Early Life and Education

### Childhood in Rural Alberta
Bandura was the youngest of six children born to parents of Eastern European descent. His father was from Krakow, Poland, and his mother from Ukraine; both immigrated to Canada as adolescents. After marrying, they settled in Mundare, Alberta, where Bandura's father worked laying track for the trans-Canada railroad.

The limitations of education in a remote town caused Bandura to become independent and self-motivated in terms of learning—traits that proved essential throughout his lengthy career.

### The Alaska Highway Experience
After high school, Bandura worked for one summer filling holes on the Alaska Highway in the Yukon. He later credited this experience in the northern tundra as the origin of his interest in human psychopathology, observing the diverse characters and behaviors among his coworkers.

### University Education
- **1949** - Bachelor's degree, University of British Columbia; received the Bolocan Award in psychology (annually awarded to the outstanding student in psychology)
- **1951** - Master's degree in psychology, University of Iowa
- **1952** - Doctorate in clinical psychology, University of Iowa

At Iowa, Bandura came under the influence of the behaviorist tradition and learning theory. He studied under Kenneth Spence (Hull-Spence learning theory) and was influenced by Robert Sears.

## Career at Stanford

### Timeline
- **1953** - Accepted one-year instructorship at Stanford University
- **1954** - Secured permanent professorship
- **1974** - Named David Starr Jordan Professor of Social Science in Psychology
- **1974** - Elected President of the American Psychological Association
- **1976** - Became chairman of the psychology department
- **2010** - Became professor emeritus

Bandura spent the entirety of his 57-year academic career at Stanford University.

## Key Works

### Social Learning Theory (1977)
Bandura's foundational text establishing the theoretical framework for understanding how people learn through observation.

**Core themes:**
- Learning occurs through observation without direct reinforcement
- Four component processes: attention, retention, motor reproduction, motivation
- Distinction between learning and performance
- Vicarious reinforcement and punishment
- Self-efficacy introduced as key concept

### Social Foundations of Thought and Action: A Social Cognitive Theory (1986)
Bandura's comprehensive theoretical statement, expanding social learning theory into social cognitive theory. Published by Prentice Hall (xiii + 617 pp).

**Core themes:**
- Triadic reciprocal causation (person, behavior, environment)
- Self-efficacy as central mechanism
- Human agency and self-regulation
- Cognitive mediators of behavior
- Renamed the theory from "Social Learning Theory" to "Social Cognitive Theory" to emphasize the role of cognition

**Reception:** Edwin A. Locke wrote in the Academy of Management Review that this was "a brilliant and important book that should be required reading for all doctoral students" and called it "a classic that will be cited for decades to come."

### Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control (1997)
The definitive treatment of self-efficacy theory, with applications across domains.

**Core themes:**
- Sources of self-efficacy (mastery, modeling, persuasion, physiological states)
- Domain-specificity of efficacy beliefs
- Self-efficacy in health, education, athletics, organizations
- Collective efficacy

### Moral Disengagement: How People Do Harm and Live with Themselves (2016)
Bandura's analysis of how moral self-sanctions are selectively disengaged. Published by Macmillan (544 pp).

**Core themes:**
- Eight cognitive mechanisms of moral disengagement
- Applications to violence, terrorism, corporate malfeasance, gun industry, entertainment industry, tobacco companies, finance and banking
- Environmental destruction and collective moral disengagement
- Countering disengagement mechanisms

### Key Journal Articles
- "The Necessary and Sufficient Conditions of Therapeutic Personality Change" (1957)
- "Transmission of Aggression Through Imitation of Aggressive Models" (1961)
- "Imitation of Film-Mediated Aggressive Models" (1963)
- "Social Cognitive Theory: An Agentic Perspective" - Annual Review of Psychology (2001)
- "Toward a Psychology of Human Agency" - Perspectives on Psychological Science (2006)

## Historical Context

### The State of Psychology When Bandura Emerged
- **Behaviorism dominated** - Skinner's operant conditioning, focus on direct reinforcement
- **Psychoanalysis offered alternative** - But with untestable unconscious mechanisms
- **Learning theory was limited** - Direct experience and reinforcement as only mechanisms
- **Causation was seen as one-way** - Environment acts on organism

### Bandura's Revolutionary Contributions
1. **Demonstrated observational learning** - Showed learning occurs through observation without direct reinforcement
2. **Introduced self-efficacy construct** - Established beliefs as causal forces
3. **Developed reciprocal determinism** - Challenged unidirectional causation
4. **Restored human agency** - Positioned people as active agents, not passive responders
5. **Made therapy observable** - Recorded and analyzed actual therapeutic processes

## The Bobo Doll Experiments

### The 1961 Study
**Aim:** Investigate whether children learn aggressive behaviors through observing adults, and whether gender impacts imitation.

**Participants:** 72 children (36 boys, 36 girls), ages 3-6, enrolled at Stanford University Nursery School.

**Methodology:**
- Used matched pair design, pre-testing children for aggression levels
- Three groups: aggressive adult model, non-aggressive model, control (no model)
- Aggressive model physically and verbally abused the Bobo doll
- Children were mildly frustrated before being placed in room with Bobo doll

**Key Findings:**
- Children exposed to aggressive models were more likely to display aggressive behaviors
- Boys showed more physical aggression than girls
- Children were more influenced by same-sex adult models
- Imitative physical aggressions: boys 38.2, girls 12.7

### The 1963 Study
**Aim:** Examine differences in imitated aggression after witnessing filmed or cartoon models compared to live models.

**Participants:** 96 children (48 girls, 48 boys) from Stanford University nursery.

**Groups:**
1. Live model becoming aggressive
2. Film version of human model
3. Cartoon version (aggressive cat)

**Key Findings:**
- All three groups showed similar increases in aggressive behavior compared to control
- Children imitate aggressive behavior regardless of how it is presented
- Televised models resulted in highest violence scores
- Boys showed greater aggression consistent with 1961

### Significance
- Challenged behaviorist assumption that learning requires direct reinforcement
- Demonstrated mechanisms of aggression transmission
- Profound implications for understanding media violence
- Became one of the most famous experiments in psychology

## Core Concepts (Reference)

### Self-Efficacy Theory
Belief in one's capability to execute actions required to produce specific outcomes. Not general confidence but domain-specific beliefs.

**The Four Sources (in order of strength):**

| Source | Description | Strength |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Mastery Experiences | Direct success in performing the task | Strongest |
| Vicarious Experiences | Observing similar others succeed | Second |
| Verbal Persuasion | Being told one can succeed (depends on credibility) | Third |
| Physiological/Emotional States | Interpreting arousal as readiness vs. anxiety | Fourth |

**Key Insight:** Self-efficacy affects choice of activities, effort expenditure, persistence in face of obstacles, and ultimate performance.

### Reciprocal Determinism (Triadic Reciprocal Causation)

Three components in continuous mutual influence:

```
        Person (P)
       /         \
      ↕           ↕
Behavior (B) ←→ Environment (E)
```

- **P → B**: Beliefs and expectations shape actions
- **B → E**: Actions change circumstances
- **E → P**: Circumstances shape beliefs
- All operate simultaneously, not sequentially

**Significance:** Challenged both behaviorist (E → B) and psychoanalytic (internal drives) one-way causation. Positioned humans as both products and producers of their environment.

### The Four Core Properties of Human Agency

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Intentionality** | Forming intentions with action plans and strategies |
| **Forethought** | Temporal extension of agency—setting goals, anticipating outcomes |
| **Self-Reactiveness** | Self-regulation—constructing courses of action and regulating execution |
| **Self-Reflectiveness** | Examining one's own functioning, reflecting on efficacy and meaning |

### Three Modes of Agency

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Personal Agency** | Individual brings influence to bear on what they can control |
| **Proxy Agency** | Influencing others who have resources to act on one's behalf |
| **Collective Agency** | Pooling knowledge, skills, resources to act in concert |

### Four Processes of Observational Learning

| Process | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Attention** | Observer must attend to the model; affected by sleepiness, illness, distraction |
| **Retention** | Behavior stored symbolically in memory; organized into recalled templates |
| **Motor Reproduction** | Ability to perform the observed behavior using internal symbolic images |
| **Motivation** | Reasons for imitating; perceived rewards must outweigh costs |

**Key Insight:** First two processes describe how we learn; second two describe how we perform.

### Eight Mechanisms of Moral Disengagement

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **1. Moral Justification** | Harmful conduct made acceptable by serving moral purposes |
| **2. Euphemistic Labeling** | Sanitizing language that decontaminates destructive behavior |
| **3. Advantageous Comparison** | Own harm seems benign compared to others' |
| **4. Displacement of Responsibility** | Believing one is not the real agent ("following orders") |
| **5. Diffusion of Responsibility** | Shared responsibility dilutes individual accountability |
| **6. Distortion of Consequences** | Minimizing or ignoring the harm caused |
| **7. Dehumanization** | Stripping victims of human qualities |
| **8. Attribution of Blame** | Blaming victims for their own suffering |

### Collective Efficacy

"A group's shared belief in its conjoint capability to organize and execute the courses of action required to produce given levels of attainment" (Bandura, 1997, p. 477).

**Key findings:**
- Collective efficacy predicts team performance better than combined individual self-efficacy scores
- Same four sources as individual self-efficacy apply to collective efficacy
- Factors include member empowerment, clear goals, unified approach, supportive leadership
- Application domains: education, sports, organizations, neighborhoods, crime prevention

## Famous Quotes

### On Self-Efficacy
- "Self-belief does not necessarily ensure success, but self-disbelief assuredly spawns failure."
- "People's beliefs about their abilities have a profound effect on those abilities. Ability is not a fixed property; there is huge variability in how you perform."
- "People who believe they have the power to exercise some measure of control over their lives are healthier, more effective and more successful than those who lack faith in their ability to effect changes in their lives."
- "In order to succeed, people need a sense of self-efficacy, to struggle together with resilience to meet the inevitable obstacles and inequities of life."

### On Human Agency
- "The human mind is generative, creative, proactive, and reflective—not just reactive."
- "Humans are producers of their life circumstance not just products of them."
- "People are not just onlookers of their behavior. They are agents of it."
- "People are partly the products of their environment, but by selecting, creating, and transforming their environmental circumstances they are producers of environments as well."

### On Observational Learning
- "Fortunately, most human behavior is learned observationally through modeling from others."
- "Learning would be exceedingly laborious, not to mention hazardous, if people had to rely solely on the effects of their own actions to inform them what to do."

### On Social Cognitive Theory
- "In the social learning view, people are neither driven by inner forces nor buffeted by environmental stimuli. Rather, psychological functioning is explained in terms of a continuous reciprocal interaction of personal and environmental determinants."

### On Moral Disengagement
- "Where everyone is responsible, no one is really responsible."
- "Moral justification is a powerful disengagement mechanism. Destructive conduct is made personally and socially acceptable by portraying it in the service of moral ends."
- "Given appropriate social conditions, decent, ordinary people can be led to do extraordinarily cruel things."

### On Psychology's Role
- "Psychology cannot tell people how they ought to live their lives. It can however, provide them with the means for effecting personal and social change."
