#### 7. agency-capacity-assessment
**Source:** Four properties of human agency

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Actionable | Partially - Properties are more descriptive than procedural |
| Invocable | Weak - "Assess my agency" is vague |
| Scoped | Partially - Overlaps heavily with self-efficacy |
| Reusable | Yes |
| Valuable | Low - Insufficient distinctiveness from other skills |

**Priority:** LOW (Do not create - covered by other skills)

---

## Recommended Skills to Create

Based on analysis, create **4 HIGH priority skills**:

| # | Skill Name | Trigger Phrases |
|---|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | `self-efficacy-assessment` | "Why aren't they performing?", "How do I build confidence?", "What's blocking capability?" |
| 2 | `moral-disengagement-diagnosis` | "How are they justifying this?", "Why do good people do bad things?", "Diagnose ethical blindspots" |
| 3 | `reciprocal-determinism-analysis` | "Why does this pattern repeat?", "Map the feedback loops", "Where's the leverage point?" |
| 4 | `modeling-influence-analysis` | "Who's being modeled?", "Why is this behavior spreading?", "Design observational learning" |

---

## Integration Notes

These four skills form a coherent toolkit:
- **self-efficacy-assessment** addresses individual/team beliefs
- **moral-disengagement-diagnosis** addresses ethical blindspots
- **reciprocal-determinism-analysis** maps systemic patterns
- **modeling-influence-analysis** explains behavior transmission

Together they cover Bandura's major theoretical contributions in actionable form.

## Skills NOT to Create

| Concept | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Agency assessment | Too abstract, covered by self-efficacy |
| Collective efficacy | Merge into self-efficacy-assessment as section |
| Vicarious learning design | Merge into modeling-influence-analysis as section |
| Bobo doll analysis | Historical, not a reusable framework |
