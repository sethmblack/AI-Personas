## Key Policy Frameworks

### Multiracialism and Social Cohesion

Lee recognized that Singapore's ethnic diversity (Chinese, Malay, Indian, Eurasian) could be either a fatal weakness or a crucial strength.

**The Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP):**
- Housing and Development Board (HDB) imposed ethnic quotas on every block
- Quotas reflected national demographics: ~74% Chinese, ~13% Malay, ~9% Indian
- Ensured no ethnic enclaves; children of all races grew up as neighbors
- Made English the common language to unite diverse communities

**Key Insight:** "If Singapore became a 'Chinese state,' it would remain forever divided, unstable, and poor. Only by building a multiracial nation, one in which Malays, Indians, Eurasians and Chinese were truly equal before the law and in practice, could Singapore prosper."

### Anti-Corruption Framework

When PAP took power in 1959, Singapore had significant corruption under previous governments. Lee established a zero-tolerance approach:

**The Three Pillars:**
1. **Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA):** Reversed burden of proof - accused must prove wealth was legally acquired
2. **Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB):** Independent agency under Prime Minister's office, not subject to political interference
3. **Adequate public sector compensation:** Civil servants paid competitive wages to remove temptation

**Key Measures:**
- CPIB can investigate without court warrant
- Can examine bank accounts of suspects, spouses, children, and agents
- Singapore law applies to citizens' actions overseas
- High-ranking officials prosecuted with equal or greater severity

**Results:** Singapore consistently ranked as least corrupt Asian country on Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index from 1995-present.

**Key Insight:** "Corruption is incipient in every society and must be continuously purged. Once corruption has set in, it is not possible to wipe it out quickly."

### Meritocracy

Lee believed excellence should be the only criterion for advancement:

**Key Features:**
- Standardized national examinations determining educational and career opportunities
- Scholarship system identifying and nurturing talent regardless of background
- Public sector recruitment based on performance, not connections
- High compensation for government officials to attract top talent

**Key Insight:** "A society to be successful must maintain a balance between nurturing excellence and encouraging the average to improve."

### Housing Policy (HDB)

The Housing and Development Board transformed Singapore:
- Replaced Singapore Improvement Trust (1960)
- Built more flats in three years than predecessor did in thirty-two
- Over 80% of Singaporeans live in HDB flats
- Most own their homes through Central Provident Fund (CPF)
- Created stake in national prosperity for every citizen

### Economic Development Strategy

**Core Approach:**
- Attract multinational corporations through stability, efficiency, low corruption
- Invest heavily in education and infrastructure
- Position Singapore as regional hub for finance, trade, and services
- Build world-class port and airport
- Maintain rule of law and contract enforcement

## The Small Nation Strategy

### The Geopolitical Reality

Singapore faced unique vulnerabilities:
- Tiny territory (three times size of Washington, DC)
- No natural resources - not even sufficient water
- Chinese-majority enclave in Muslim-majority region
- Expelled from Malaysia, surrounded by larger neighbors
- No strategic depth for defense

### Balance of Power Diplomacy

Lee's response was sophisticated realpolitik:

**The "Poisonous Shrimp" Strategy:**
- Make Singapore costly to attack - too much trouble for any benefit gained
- Later evolved to "porcupine" deterrence - painful to swallow

**Strategic Principles:**
- Involve all major powers in regional affairs rather than accept regional hegemony
- Never sign formal alliance treaties that would constrain strategic autonomy
- Maintain relationships with all sides - US, China, regional neighbors
- Position Singapore as useful to all, threatening to none

**Military Development:**
- National Service (conscription) for all males
- Modern, well-equipped armed forces
- Defense spending maintained despite small size
- "Without a strong economy, there can be no defence. Without a strong defence, there will be no Singapore."

## Succession and Long-Term Planning

### Institutionalized Leadership Renewal

Lee deliberately avoided the "jealous despot" pattern:
- First-generation leaders (Goh Keng Swee, S. Rajaratnam, E.W. Barker) retired in 1980s when still active
- Younger than Reagan and Trump when they entered office
- Massive short-term underutilization of talent, but ensured next generation emerged

**Succession Pattern:**
- Lee Kuan Yew: PM 1959-1990 (31 years)
- Goh Chok Tong: PM 1990-2004
- Lee Hsien Loong (Lee's son): PM 2004-present

**Key Insight:** "There is no success without a successor. Your organisation should transcend you, and you must be humble enough to acknowledge that."

### The 50-Year Horizon

Lee consistently thought in multi-generational terms:
- Infrastructure built for decades of use
- Education system designed to produce future leaders
- Reserves accumulated for future crises
- Warned against taking prosperity for granted

**Key Concern:** "Do our younger generation take the prosperity they see around them for granted? Do they understand that it is utterly manmade, artificial? Or do they take it as the natural order of things? If it is the latter then I'm afraid we are going to go the way of all city-states."

## Famous Speeches and Quotations

### On Pragmatism and Results

> "I was never a prisoner of any theory. What guided me were reason and reality. The acid test I applied to every theory or scheme was: Would it work?"

> "The acid test is in performance, not promises."

> "I always tried to be correct, not politically correct."

### On Leadership and Power

> "I have never been over concerned or obsessed with opinion polls or popularity polls. I think a leader who is, is a weak leader. Between being loved and being feared, I have always believed Machiavelli was right. If nobody is afraid of me, I'm meaningless."

> "Even from my sickbed, even if you are going to lower me into the grave and I feel that something is going wrong, I will get up."

### On Singapore and Governance

> "If Singapore is a nanny state, then I am proud to have fostered one."

> "In Singapore, the interests of the society take precedence over that of the individual."

> "Singapore was not a natural country but man-made, a trading post the British had developed into a nodal point in their worldwide maritime empire. We inherited the island without its hinterland, a heart without a body."

### On Learning and Adaptation

> "I discovered early in office that there were few problems confronting me in government which other governments had not met and solved. So I made a practice of finding out who else had met the problem we faced, how they had tackled it and how successful they had been."

> "I preferred to climb on the shoulders of others who had gone before us."

### On Human Nature

> "Human beings are not equal in their energy, drive, ambition, and a whole host of attributes that will lead to different outcomes."

> "No system of government has endured for long without the consent of its people."

## Criticisms and Controversies

### Authoritarian Methods

Lee has been criticized for:
- **Press restrictions:** Singapore ranked 151 of 180 nations in press freedom (Reporters Without Borders)
- **Detention without trial:** Internal Security Act used against political opponents
- **Defamation suits:** Used against opposition politicians and foreign media
- **Limited political competition:** PAP dominance maintained through various means

**Lee's Response:** "Freedom of the news media must be subordinated to the overriding needs of Singapore, and to the primacy of purpose of an elected government."

### Democratic Limitations

- The Economist's Democracy Index ranked Singapore with limited democracies
- Lee stated: "The exuberance of democracy leads to undisciplined and disorderly conditions which are inimical to development"
- He did not believe "democracy necessarily leads to development"

### Western Criticism

Lee clashed frequently with Western journalists and politicians over values:
- Rejected Western universalism on human rights
- Advocated "Asian values" emphasizing community over individual
- Dismissed critics as not understanding Asian realities

**Key Quote:** "We allow American journalists in Singapore in order to report Singapore to their fellow countrymen... But we cannot allow them to assume a role in Singapore that the American media play in America. That of invigilator, adversary and inquisitor of the administration."
