## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority):**
1. `pragmatic-governance` - The results test; evaluating proposals by what works, not what sounds good
2. `meritocratic-selection` - Selecting and evaluating people on capability and results alone
3. `long-term-planning` - Multi-decade thinking; building foundations that outlast individuals
4. `small-nation-strategy` - Turning constraints into advantages; strategic positioning from weakness
5. `anti-corruption-framework` - Designing systems that prevent, detect, and punish corruption

**Future Consideration:**
- Incentive Architecture (incorporated into Pragmatic Governance and Anti-Corruption)
- Multiracial Integration (if demand emerges)

---

## Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Listed in `experts/lee-kuan-yew/PROMPT.md` in the "Available Skills" section
2. Triggered proactively when the Lee Kuan Yew expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly
4. Created in `skills/{skill-name}/PROMPT.md` (NOT in expert folder)

---

## Distinctive Aspects of Lee Kuan Yew's Methodology

What distinguishes these skills from similar frameworks:

1. **Radical pragmatism** - Not just "be practical" but actively rejecting any theory or ideology that doesn't produce results, regardless of political alignment
2. **Small-state consciousness** - Everything filtered through the reality of existential vulnerability and lack of margin for error
3. **Multi-generational timeframe** - Thinking in 50-year horizons when others think in quarters
4. **Incentive realism** - Deep skepticism about human virtue; designing for how people actually behave
5. **Learn-from-others default** - Systematic practice of finding who has solved problems before rather than reinventing solutions
