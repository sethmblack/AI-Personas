## HIGH Priority

### 1. strategic-reinvention

**Score: 47/50**

**Source Pattern:** The Deliberate Break / The Five Reinventions
**Purpose:** Guide individuals or organizations through intentional transformation before external forces demand it—leaving success to find the next thing.
**Trigger:** "How do I know when to reinvent?" or "Should I pivot?" or "I'm successful but feeling stagnant" or "When do I change direction?"
**Inputs:** Current position (what's working), signs of staleness or commodification, emerging signals in environment, risk tolerance
**Outputs:** Assessment of reinvention timing, framework for deliberate transformation, identification of "the next thing," transition plan that accepts temporary confusion

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 10 - Clear 5-step pattern from Miles's career (achieve mastery → feel comfort → move away → accept confusion → define new territory)
- Invocable: 9 - Strong trigger phrases; common entrepreneurial/creative question
- Scoped: 9 - Focused on the specific decision and process of reinvention
- Reusable: 10 - Applies to careers, products, companies, creative work, brands
- Valuable: 9 - Prevents the common error of riding success into irrelevance

### 2. creative-team-assembly

**Score: 45/50**

**Source Pattern:** Talent Recognition / Provocative Leadership
**Purpose:** Identify and assemble teams optimized for discovery and innovation rather than safe execution—finding people who "get it" rather than people with the right credentials.
**Trigger:** "How do I build an innovative team?" or "Who should I hire for this?" or "How do I find people who can do something new?"
**Inputs:** Mission requiring innovation, candidate pool, current team dynamics, willingness to challenge conventions
**Outputs:** Criteria for identifying unconventional talent, interview/evaluation approaches, team composition recommendations, onboarding for discovery-oriented work

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9 - Clear criteria (raw capacity vs. credentials, ability to hear something new, not constrained by convention)
- Invocable: 9 - Common hiring/team-building question
- Scoped: 9 - Focused on team assembly for innovation
- Reusable: 9 - Applies to startups, creative teams, R&D, any innovation context
- Valuable: 9 - Significant competitive advantage; prevents hiring for safety over discovery

### 3. productive-discomfort

**Score: 44/50**

**Source Pattern:** The Uncomfortable Assignment / Provocative Leadership
**Purpose:** Design conditions that push individuals or teams beyond comfort into the "ugly zone" where growth and discovery happen—structured discomfort that produces breakthroughs.
**Trigger:** "My team is stale" or "How do I push someone to grow?" or "We're too comfortable" or "How do I create conditions for innovation?"
**Inputs:** Current comfort zone, desired growth area, individuals/team involved, tolerance for temporary failure
**Outputs:** Specific uncomfortable assignments, constraints that force new approaches, framework for supporting people through productive struggle

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9 - Miles's techniques are specific (unrehearsed songs, foreign keys, minimal instruction, wrong-background hiring)
- Invocable: 9 - Triggered by common leadership/management concerns
- Scoped: 8 - Focused on creating growth conditions through discomfort
- Reusable: 9 - Applies to teams, individuals, educational settings, creative projects
- Valuable: 9 - Addresses common problem of teams optimizing for safety over growth

### 4. essential-signal-extraction

**Score: 42/50**

**Source Pattern:** The Space Between / "I always listen to what I can leave out"
**Purpose:** Ruthlessly edit to find the essential signal in noise—what to cut, what to keep, where the real meaning lives in the spaces and silences.
**Trigger:** "This is too complicated" or "What's essential here?" or "Help me simplify" or "What should I cut?"
**Inputs:** Overly complex content, communication, strategy, or product; desired outcome
**Outputs:** Identification of what to remove, what creates actual meaning, how silence/space/absence functions

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 8 - Framework exists but requires judgment (what creates actual meaning vs. what's just noise)
- Invocable: 9 - Strong trigger phrases; common editing/simplification need
- Scoped: 8 - Focused on simplification and essence-finding
- Reusable: 9 - Applies to writing, products, strategy, communication, design
- Valuable: 8 - Prevents common over-complication error

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. mistake-momentum

**Score: 38/50**

**Source Pattern:** No Wrong Notes / "It's not the note you play that's wrong..."
**Purpose:** Convert errors into opportunities by focusing on what comes next—maintaining momentum and treating mistakes as material rather than failures.
**Trigger:** "I made a mistake, what now?" or "How do I recover from this?" or "I'm afraid of failing"
**Inputs:** The mistake or error, current situation, available next moves
**Outputs:** Reframe of error as material, identification of follow-up moves that transform the mistake, confidence framework for continuing

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 7 - Principle is clear but application is situational
- Invocable: 8 - Common fear/recovery scenario
- Scoped: 8 - Focused specifically on mistake response
- Reusable: 8 - Applies to any context where errors occur

**Trigger:** "What's coming next?" or "Where should I be looking?" or "What am I not seeing?"
**Inputs:** Current domain, adjacent domains, weak signals, emerging voices
**Outputs:** Identification of emerging patterns, assessment of timing, recommendations for positioning

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 6 - More intuitive; harder to systematize
- Invocable: 8 - Strong trigger phrases
- Scoped: 7 - Broad territory (sensing the future)
- Reusable: 8 - Applies across industries and domains

---

### 7. strategic-silence

**Score: 32/50**

**Source Pattern:** The Space Between / "In music, silence is more important than sound"
**Purpose:** Use deliberate non-action, silence, or withholding as a strategic tool—knowing when not to speak, act, or fill space.
**Trigger:** "Should I respond to this?" or "What's the right amount of communication?" or "When should I stay quiet?"
**Inputs:** Situation requiring response/action decision, stakes involved, relationship dynamics
**Outputs:** Assessment of whether action or non-action serves better, framing of strategic silence

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 6 - More judgment-based than procedural
- Invocable: 6 - Less natural trigger (people usually want to act, not not-act)
- Scoped: 7 - Focused on action/non-action decision
- Reusable: 7 - Applies to communication, negotiation, leadership
- Valuable: 6 - Valuable insight but narrow application windows
