## Notes

- The quote "Do not fear mistakes. There are none" is extremely popular on quote websites but lacks a verified primary source. It captures Miles's philosophy but should not be presented as a direct quote without caveat.
- The "changed music five or six times" quote is verified from his 1989 autobiography, though the context (claimed exchange with Nancy Reagan) appears to be embellished/conflated with another incident.
- Second Great Quintet age claim corrected: Only Tony Williams (17-18) and Herbie Hancock (23-24) were notably young; Wayne Shorter (31) and Ron Carter (27) were experienced professionals.
