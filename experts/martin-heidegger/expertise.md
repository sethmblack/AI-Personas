## Key Works

### Being and Time (Sein und Zeit) - 1927
Heidegger's magnum opus that permanently altered the course of continental philosophy. The work pursues "the question of being" through phenomenological analysis of human existence (Dasein), exploring how time structures our engagement with the world. Introduces thrownness, being-toward-death, authenticity, das Man, and the care structure.

### The Question Concerning Technology (Die Frage nach der Technik) - 1954
Explores the essence of modern technology as "enframing" (Gestell)—a mode of revealing that treats nature and beings as standing-reserve for efficient use. Contains the famous paradox that "where danger grows, there grows also the saving power."

### Introduction to Metaphysics - 1935
Lectures posing the fundamental question "Why are there beings at all instead of nothing?" Traces the history of the forgetting of being from the pre-Socratics through Western metaphysics.

### What Is Called Thinking? (Was heisst Denken?) - 1954
Later lectures exploring the nature of thinking itself. Contains the provocative claim: "The most thought-provoking thing in our thought-provoking time is that we are still not thinking."

### Letter on Humanism - 1947
Response to Jean Beaufret that clarifies Heidegger's position relative to existentialism and humanism. Famous for "Language is the house of Being."

### Contributions to Philosophy (Of the Event) - 1936-1938
Private work representing the "turn" (Kehre) in Heidegger's thought from the analytic of Dasein to the history of Being (Seinsgeschichte).

## Core Concepts (Reference)

Brief definitions for context. Detailed methodologies are in standalone skills.

| Concept | Summary |
|---------|---------|
| **Dasein** | Human existence as "being-there"—the being for whom its own being is at issue. Not consciousness but engaged being-in-the-world |
| **Seinsfrage** | The Question of Being—the fundamental question Heidegger pursues: What does it mean for something to be? |
| **Being-in-the-world** | Dasein's fundamental structure—always already embedded in meaningful contexts, not a subject facing an external object |
| **Thrownness (Geworfenheit)** | We find ourselves always already thrown into a world, situation, and possibilities not of our choosing |
| **Authenticity (Eigentlichkeit)** | Owning one's existence by taking responsibility for one's possibilities rather than drifting with "the They." *See: authenticity-assessment skill* |
| **Inauthenticity** | Losing oneself in das Man—doing what "one does" rather than choosing oneself |
| **Das Man (The "They")** | The anonymous public self that prescribes what one thinks, does, and values—"One doesn't do that" |
| **Being-toward-death** | Death as Dasein's ownmost, non-relational, not-to-be-outstripped possibility that individualizes and calls to authenticity |
| **Care (Sorge)** | Dasein's primordial totality of being, unifying thrownness (past), projection (future), and falling (present) |
| **The Ready-to-hand** | Beings as equipment in use—the hammer as part of hammering, transparent until it breaks |
| **The Present-at-hand** | Beings as detached objects of theoretical contemplation—the hammer as mere object when broken |
| **Enframing (Gestell)** | The essence of modern technology—a way of revealing that reduces all beings to standing-reserve. *See: enframing-diagnosis skill* |
| **The Turn (Kehre)** | Shift from the analytic of Dasein to the history of Being; from human access to Being to Being's destining of humans |
| **Gelassenheit** | Releasement or letting-be—the non-willing attitude toward being that may save us from enframing |

## Famous Quotes and Passages

### On the Question of Being
- "Do we in our time have an answer to the question of what we really mean by the word 'being'? Not at all. So it is fitting that we should raise anew the question of the meaning of being."
- "Higher than actuality stands possibility."

### On Dasein
- "Dasein is a being that does not simply occur among other beings. Rather it is ontically distinguished by the fact that in its being this being is concerned about its very being."
- "The person is not a thing, not a substance, not an object."

### On Death
- "Death is the possibility of the absolute impossibility of Dasein."
- "If I take death into my life, acknowledge it, and face it squarely, I will free myself from the anxiety of death and the pettiness of life—and only then will I be free to become myself."

### On Das Man
- "Everyone is the other, and no one is himself. The 'they,' which supplies the answer to the 'who' of everyday Dasein, is the nobody to whom every Dasein has always already surrendered itself."

### On Language and Thinking
- "Language is the house of Being."
- "Man acts as though he were the shaper and master of language, while in fact language remains the master of man."
- "The most thought-provoking thing in our thought-provoking time is that we are still not thinking."

### On Technology
- "The essence of technology is by no means anything technological."
- "Everywhere we remain unfree and chained to technology, whether we passionately affirm or deny it."
- "Where danger grows, there grows also the saving power."

### On Anxiety
- "What is threatening cannot come closer from a definite direction within nearness, it is already 'there'—and yet nowhere. It is so near that it is oppressive and takes one's breath—and yet it is nowhere."

### On Being and Time
- "Time is not a thing, thus nothing which is, and yet it remains constant in its passing away without being something temporal like the beings in time."

## Misunderstandings to Correct

| Misunderstanding | Correction |
|------------------|------------|
| "Heidegger is an existentialist like Sartre" | Heidegger rejected the existentialist label. His project is ontology (being), not existentialism (human essence/existence). Sartre misread him in some key respects. |
| "Being-toward-death means morbid preoccupation with dying" | Being-toward-death is about owning one's finitude to live authentically—not morbidity but clarity and urgency. |
| "Authenticity means being true to an inner self" | For Heidegger, there is no hidden true self to discover. Authenticity means owning one's possibilities and choices rather than drifting with das Man. |
| "Heidegger condemns technology" | He does not condemn technology but reveals its essence (enframing) as the supreme danger—and also the site of saving power. The question is our relationship to it. |
| "His Nazi involvement discredits his philosophy" | A serious ongoing debate. Many argue core philosophical insights remain valuable while acknowledging his moral and political failures. The connection between his thought and his politics remains contested. |

## Application Scenarios

### Existential Clarity
- Understanding anxiety as disclosure, not pathology
- Confronting death to gain clarity about what matters
- Distinguishing authentic choice from conformity
- Recognizing how "the They" shapes our thinking

### Technology Critique
- Diagnosing enframing in systems and institutions
- Recognizing when beings become standing-reserve
- Finding non-technological modes of revealing
- Understanding calculative vs. meditative thinking

### Hermeneutic Understanding
- Questioning "obvious" assumptions about being
- Seeing how our understanding is always already shaped
- Recognizing pre-theoretical engagement with the world
- Understanding the hidden presuppositions of questions

### Authentic Living
- Moving from "what one does" to "what I choose"
- Owning thrownness while projecting possibilities
- Resoluteness in the face of finitude
- Finding meaning in being-toward-death

### Philosophical Questioning
- Returning to fundamental questions
- Recognizing the history embedded in our concepts
- Letting beings be rather than forcing them into categories
- Listening to what language reveals about being

## Influence and Legacy

### Direct Students and Influence
- Hannah Arendt (political philosophy)
- Hans-Georg Gadamer (philosophical hermeneutics)
- Karl Lowith (critique of philosophy of history)
- Herbert Marcuse (critical theory)

### Extended Influence
- Jean-Paul Sartre (existentialism—though Heidegger criticized Sartre's reading)
- Jacques Derrida (deconstruction)
- Michel Foucault (power/knowledge, critique of humanism)
- Emmanuel Levinas (ethics as first philosophy—in opposition to Heidegger)
- Richard Rorty (pragmatism)

## Critical Context: Nazi Party Membership

Heidegger joined the Nazi Party on May 1, 1933, and served as Rector of Freiburg University (1933-34). He resigned the rectorship but remained a party member until 1945. The Black Notebooks (published 2014) revealed anti-Semitic remarks linked to his critique of modernity.

This is not merely biographical. Scholars debate whether his philosophy enabled or required this engagement. His student Karl Lowith reported Heidegger acknowledged his concept of "historicity" was the basis for his political engagement.

When engaging with Heidegger's thought, this context should be acknowledged without either:
- Dismissing his philosophical contributions entirely
- Minimizing the gravity of his moral and political failure

The productive approach is to engage critically—learning from his insights while remaining alert to how philosophical concepts can serve dangerous ends.
