## HIGH Priority

### 1. pascalian-wager-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The Wager / Decision Theory Under Uncertainty
**Purpose:** Analyze decisions under radical uncertainty using Pascal's wager framework to identify stakes, calculate expected value, and recommend action when proof is impossible.
**Trigger:** "What should I do when I can't know for certain?" or "Help me decide when evidence is insufficient" or "Apply the wager to this decision"
**Inputs:** Decision context, available choices, potential outcomes and their stakes
**Outputs:** Structured analysis showing: options matrix, infinite vs finite stakes identification, asymmetric payoff analysis, and recommended action with reasoning
**Reasoning:** Clear 4-step process (frame uncertainty, identify stakes, calculate asymmetric payoffs, recommend wager). Applies to any high-stakes decision under uncertainty - career choices, relationships, belief systems. Saves significant effort by providing systematic framework for decisions that seem undecidable.

### 2. diversion-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** Diversions Analysis / Flight from Self
**Purpose:** Diagnose patterns of busyness and distraction as flight from existential confrontation, identify what is being avoided, and point toward authentic engagement.
**Trigger:** "Why am I always so busy?" or "I feel empty despite constant activity" or "Diagnose my diversions"
**Inputs:** Description of activities, time allocation, emotional state, areas of avoidance
**Outputs:** Diagnosis identifying: diversionary patterns, what is being fled (mortality, meaninglessness, self-knowledge), the cost of flight, and path toward sitting in the room
**Reasoning:** Actionable 5-step diagnostic framework from Pascal's diversions teaching. High frequency use case - modern life is defined by distraction. Provides unique insight distinguishing symptoms (busyness) from disease (flight from self). Saves significant therapeutic/coaching effort.

### 3. greatness-wretchedness-paradox

**Source Pattern:** The Anthropological Argument / Human Condition Analysis
**Purpose:** Analyze human situations by holding together the paradox of greatness and wretchedness, showing dignity within fragility and nobility within suffering.
**Trigger:** "I feel worthless" or "Help me understand this suffering" or "Apply the paradox of greatness and wretchedness"
**Inputs:** Description of suffering, failure, or self-assessment; context of the wretchedness being experienced
**Outputs:** Paradoxical reframe showing: how awareness of wretchedness demonstrates greatness, the dignity inherent in the suffering, and the path from despair to authentic self-knowledge
**Reasoning:** Core to Pascal's anthropology and apologetics. Actionable through clear reframing methodology. High value for addressing despair, failure, imposter syndrome. Unique approach that neither minimizes suffering nor wallows in it.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. pensee-craft

**Source Pattern:** Fragment Form / Aphoristic Writing
**Purpose:** Transform verbose or systematic content into compressed, memorable fragments (pensées) that deliver truth with maximum impact and respect for mystery.
**Trigger:** "Make this more memorable" or "Compress this into a fragment" or "Write this as a pensée"
**Inputs:** Idea or insight to be compressed, context for the fragment, intended audience
**Outputs:** One or more pensées (fragments) that compress the insight into memorable, paradoxical, or haunting form with concrete images and personal urgency
**Reasoning:** Distinctive methodology with clear before/after transformation. Useful for writing memorable content, developing aphorisms, creating impact. Less frequent than existential analysis skills but valuable for communication.

### 5. three-orders-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Three Orders (Body, Mind, Charity)
**Purpose:** Assess which order (body, mind, or charity/heart) a person or situation is operating from, identify the limits of each, and point toward integration through charity.
**Trigger:** "What order am I operating from?" or "Why isn't my reasoning enough?" or "Assess the three orders"
**Inputs:** Description of approach to a problem or life situation, what faculties are being relied upon
**Outputs:** Assessment identifying: current dominant order, its limitations, the infinite distance to higher orders, and guidance for ascending or integrating
**Reasoning:** Foundational Pascal framework with clear diagnostic criteria. Moderate frequency - applies when someone is stuck despite effort in one domain. Provides unique insight about why intellect alone fails for spiritual/existential matters.

## LOW Priority

### 6. cleopatra-nose-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Historical Contingency / Small Causes, Large Effects
**Purpose:** Analyze how small, seemingly insignificant factors can produce enormous consequences, undermining deterministic confidence.
**Trigger:** "How did something so small change everything?" or "Analyze the contingency"
**Inputs:** Historical or personal event, the small factor that shifted outcomes
**Outputs:** Analysis showing the chain of contingency, humility about prediction, and recognition that human life is shaped by impenetrable chance
**Reasoning:** Interesting application but narrow scope. Less actionable than diagnostic frameworks. Works as enhancement to other analyses rather than standalone skill.
