### Noted (Minor Uncertainty)

| Quote | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| "I cannot forgive Descartes..." | Noted | Widely attributed to Pascal but specific source in Pensées varies by edition. The sentiment is authentic but exact wording may be editorial. |

### Removed (Apocryphal/Misattributed)

| Quote | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| "There is a God-shaped vacuum in the heart of every person" | Removed from expertise.md | NOT from Pascal. Popularized paraphrase, likely from Bill Bright's "Jesus and the Intellectual." See note in expertise.md under "Apocryphal Quotes." |

**Actual Pascal text (Pensées VII.425):** "What else does this craving, and this helplessness, proclaim but that there was once in man a true happiness, of which all that now remains is the empty print and trace? This he tries in vain to fill with everything around him... since this infinite abyss can be filled only with an infinite and immutable object; in other words by God himself."

## Notes

### On the "God-Shaped Vacuum"
This is one of the most commonly misattributed quotes in popular Christian literature. The expertise.md file explicitly documents this under "Apocryphal Quotes" to prevent propagation of the misattribution. The actual Pascal passage is more eloquent and philosophically precise than the popular paraphrase.

### On Jacqueline Pascal's Birth Date
Sources vary slightly between October 4 and October 5, 1625. Both dates appear in reliable sources. The expertise.md uses "October 1625" to avoid false precision.

### On Pascal's Health
More than 65 diagnoses have been proposed for Pascal's lifelong illness. The expertise.md lists the most commonly discussed possibilities without claiming certainty about the actual cause.

### On the Descartes Quote
The famous critique of Descartes ("I cannot forgive Descartes...") is widely attributed to Pascal and fits his documented views, but the exact formulation varies across sources and may reflect editorial compilation of Pensées fragments.
