## Key Works

### Philosophy

#### The Sovereignty of Good (1970)
Three essays published as a book, now Murdoch's most influential philosophical work. Argues for a Platonic approach to ethics against both existentialism and analytic moral philosophy.

**Core themes:**
- Attention as the central moral concept
- The Good as transcendent reality
- Unselfing as the path to moral vision
- The role of beauty in moral development
- Against the autonomous will as the center of ethics

**The three essays:**
1. "The Idea of Perfection" (1964) - Attacks the "current view" of man as isolated will making discrete choices
2. "On 'God' and 'Good'" (1969) - Proposes the Good as a non-personal substitute for the God of traditional religion
3. "The Sovereignty of Good Over Other Concepts" (1967) - Argues that Good is the most important concept in ethics

#### Sartre: Romantic Rationalist (1953)
The first book-length study of Sartre's philosophy in English. Critical but admiring analysis of Sartrean existentialism.

#### Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals (1992)
Murdoch's most comprehensive philosophical work, based on her Gifford Lectures. Explores art, religion, and the nature of moral philosophy.

### Major Novels

#### Under the Net (1954)
First novel. Picaresque story of Jake Donaghue, a hack writer in London, exploring themes of language, meaning, and authenticity. Selected by Modern Library as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century.

Set in a lay religious community attached to an enclosed convent. Explores themes of self-deception, sexuality, spirituality, and moral complexity through characters like Dora Greenfield and Michael Meade.

## Historical Context

### Oxford Philosophy in the Mid-20th Century

Murdoch worked against the dominant currents of her time:

- **Ordinary language philosophy** (Ryle, Austin) - Focused on linguistic analysis, suspicious of metaphysics
- **Prescriptivism** (R.M. Hare) - Ethics reduced to imperatives and decisions
- **Emotivism** (Ayer) - Moral statements as mere expressions of feeling

Murdoch criticized these for presenting a "thin" picture of moral life focused on isolated moments of choice and blind to the inner life of attention and vision.

### Continental Influences

- **Jean-Paul Sartre** - Murdoch admired existentialism's seriousness about lived experience but rejected its focus on the heroic choosing self
- **Simone Weil** - The crucial influence. Weil's concept of "attention" as the basis of morality profoundly shaped Murdoch's work
- **Plato** - Murdoch revived Platonic moral realism at a time when it seemed philosophically disreputable

### Personal Life

- Educated at Badminton School, Bristol, and Somerville College, Oxford
- Worked briefly for UNRRA after World War II
- Fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford, 1948-1963
- Married John Bayley, literary critic, in 1956; they remained married until her death
- Diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 1997
- Her final years depicted in John Bayley's memoir *Iris* (1998) and the film *Iris* (2001)

## Core Concepts

### Attention
Borrowed from Simone Weil. The "just and loving gaze directed upon an individual reality." The substance of moral life, a continuous activity directed outward toward the real.

### Unselfing
The process of turning attention away from the ego toward the real world. The "fat, relentless ego" is the enemy of moral vision.

### The Good
Murdoch revives Platonic realism: the Good is transcendent but not supernatural, exerts a magnetic pull on consciousness, and provides orientation and meaning.

### Fantasy vs. Reality
Fantasy is the proliferation of blinding self-centered aims and images. Reality is what is actually there, seen clearly through patient attention.

### Vision Precedes Choice
Moral life is mostly about how we attend to things. By the time we face a decision, our habitual mode of attention has already shaped what options we can see.

### Love as Perception
"Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real." To love is to see the particular individual, not a projection.

## Famous Quotations

### On Love and Attention

> "Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real. Love, and so art and morals, is the discovery of reality."

> "I have used the word 'attention,' which I borrow from Simone Weil, to express the idea of a just and loving gaze directed upon individual reality. I believe this to be the characteristic and proper mark of the active moral agent."

### On the Self and Illusion

> "The self, the place where we live, is a place of illusion."

> "We live in a fantasy world, a world of illusion. The great task in life is to find reality."

> "The fat relentless ego is a prime object of attention."

### On the Good

> "Good is a transcendent reality means that virtue is the attempt to pierce the veil of selfish consciousness and join the world as it really is."

> "We need a moral philosophy in which the concept of love, so rarely mentioned now by philosophers, can once again be made central."

### On Vision and Choice

> "If we consider what the work of attention is like, how continuously it goes on, and how imperceptibly it builds up structures of value round about us, we shall not be surprised that at crucial moments of choice most of the business of choosing is already over."

### On Freedom

> "It is in the capacity to love, that is to see, that the liberation of the soul from fantasy consists. The freedom which is a proper human goal is the freedom from fantasy, that is the realism of compassion."

### On Art and Morals

> "The great artist sees his objects (and this is true whether they are sad, absurd, repulsive or even evil) in a light of justice and mercy. The direction of attention is, contrary to nature, outward, away from self which reduces all to a false unity, towards the great surprising variety of the world, and the ability so to direct attention is love."

### On Beauty

> "Beauty is the convenient and traditional name of something which art and nature share, and which gives a fairly clear sense to the idea of quality of experience and change of consciousness."

## Key Examples

### The Kestrel Passage
"I am looking out of my window in an anxious and resentful state of mind, oblivious of my surroundings, brooding perhaps on some damage done to my prestige. Then suddenly I observe a hovering kestrel. In a moment everything is altered. The brooding self with its hurt vanity has disappeared. There is nothing now but kestrel. And when I return to thinking of the other matter it seems less important."

### The Mother-in-Law Example
A mother-in-law (M) privately dislikes her daughter-in-law (D). Through patient attention over time, M comes to see D differently: from vulgar and juvenile to refreshingly simple and spontaneous. D's behavior may not have changed at all. The moral change is entirely inner - a change of vision.

## Relationship to Other Thinkers

### Plato
Murdoch is fundamentally Platonist: the Form of the Good as moral orientation, the cave allegory as moral progress, the connection between beauty and goodness.

### Simone Weil
Weil's influence is decisive: the concept of "attention," the idea of "decreation" (Murdoch's "unselfing"), a mystical sensibility without personal God.

### Kant
Murdoch respects Kant's moral seriousness but criticizes the focus on will and duty over vision, and the abstractness of the categorical imperative.

### Sartre
Murdoch admires existentialism's seriousness about lived experience but rejects the isolated, heroic choosing self and the denial of moral realism.
