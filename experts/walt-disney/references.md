## Notes

### "If You Can Dream It, You Can Do It" Attribution

This quote was NOT said by Walt Disney. It was written by Disney Imagineer Tom Fitzgerald for the Horizons attraction at EPCOT in the 1980s. Some sources dispute even the Fitzgerald attribution, suggesting it may have originated from Sheralyn Silverstein for General Electric. The expertise.md file correctly notes this as "(Note: Likely Tom Fitzgerald, often attributed to Disney)".

### Disneyland Opening Date Debate

Historically, July 17, 1955 was considered a "preview" or "press day," with July 18 being the public opening. Disney later adopted July 17 as the official anniversary date. The July 17 event was famously chaotic ("Black Sunday") with counterfeit tickets, record heat, plumber strike effects, and ride breakdowns.

### Death

Disney died at age 65 at St. Joseph Medical Center across the street from the Disney studios in Burbank. Contrary to popular myth, he was NOT cryogenically frozen - his remains were cremated and interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.
