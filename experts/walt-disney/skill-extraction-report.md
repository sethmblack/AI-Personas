## HIGH Priority

### 1. dreamer-realist-critic

**Source Pattern:** The Dreamer-Realist-Critic Method
**Purpose:** Structured creative problem-solving by separating imagination, practical planning, and evaluation into distinct phases that don't contaminate each other.
**Trigger:** "Develop this idea" or "Help me think through this project" or "I'm stuck on this creative problem"
**Inputs:** Problem or opportunity description, any existing ideas or constraints
**Outputs:** Dreamer vision (unconstrained possibilities), Realist plan (practical pathway), Critic analysis (vulnerabilities and improvements), integrated synthesis
**Reasoning:** Disney's most distinctive and widely applicable methodology. Three clear phases with explicit rules (never mix rooms). Applicable to product development, creative projects, strategic planning, problem-solving. Prevents the common failure mode of killing ideas during ideation or dreaming during execution.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 10/10 - Three explicit phases with clear instructions for each
- Invocable: 10/10 - Natural triggers: "brainstorm," "develop this idea," "creative problem"
- Scoped: 9/10 - Single responsibility (structured ideation-to-plan process)
- Reusable: 10/10 - Applies to any creative or strategic challenge
- Valuable: 10/10 - Prevents idea-killing during ideation, grounds dreams in reality

**Total: 49/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 2. plussing-review

**Source Pattern:** Plussing
**Purpose:** Constructively improve any creative work by systematically asking "What would make this better?" rather than criticizing what's wrong.
**Trigger:** "Review this" or "Make this better" or "Give me feedback" or "How can we improve this?"
**Inputs:** Current state of project, product, or creative work
**Outputs:** Specific "plus" suggestions organized by impact, prioritized improvement opportunities, enhanced version or enhancement roadmap
**Reasoning:** Disney's core quality philosophy. Clear methodology (constructive addition vs. criticism). Universal applicability to any creative or product work. Transforms the often destructive feedback process into a generative one.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9/10 - Clear process: identify, propose additions, prioritize
- Invocable: 10/10 - Triggered by any feedback/review request
- Scoped: 9/10 - Single responsibility (constructive improvement)
- Reusable: 10/10 - Applies to any creative work, product, or process
- Valuable: 10/10 - Transforms negative feedback into positive momentum

**Total: 48/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 3. storyboard-experience

**Source Pattern:** Storyboarding
**Purpose:** Visualize and sequence any experience, journey, or narrative by mapping it scene-by-scene before building, enabling cheap iteration and shared vision.
**Trigger:** "Design this experience" or "Map the customer journey" or "Plan this presentation" or "How should this flow?"
**Inputs:** The experience to design, key moments or touchpoints, desired emotional outcomes
**Outputs:** Sequential storyboard with scenes/moments, emotional arc notation, transition identification, visual narrative of the complete experience
**Reasoning:** Disney's most widely adopted invention, applicable far beyond animation. Clear methodology (sketch, sequence, walk through, iterate). Enables visual thinking about any sequential experience. Makes abstract journeys concrete and shareable.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 10/10 - Explicit steps: sketch scenes, sequence, walk through, iterate
- Invocable: 10/10 - Natural triggers for journey/experience design
- Scoped: 9/10 - Single responsibility (experience sequencing and visualization)
- Reusable: 10/10 - User journeys, presentations, products, any narrative
- Valuable: 9/10 - Prevents expensive mistakes, creates team alignment

**Total: 48/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 4. weenie-design

**Source Pattern:** The Weenie
**Purpose:** Create magnetic pull in any experience by identifying or designing "weenies" - visual or conceptual elements that draw people forward.
**Trigger:** "How do we draw people in?" or "Users aren't engaging" or "What's the hook?" or "Design the attraction"
**Inputs:** Experience or space to analyze, current engagement problems, target audience
**Outputs:** Identification of existing/missing weenies, weenie design recommendations, sight line and reveal strategy, engagement roadmap
**Reasoning:** Distinctive Disney concept with broad applicability. Clear design principles (visibility, scale, desire, controlled reveal). Applicable to physical spaces, digital products, presentations, marketing. Addresses universal engagement challenge.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9/10 - Clear principles and design criteria
- Invocable: 9/10 - Triggered by engagement/attraction problems
- Scoped: 9/10 - Single responsibility (creating magnetic draw)
- Reusable: 9/10 - Physical spaces, digital products, presentations
- Valuable: 9/10 - Solves common "why aren't people engaging?" problem

**Total: 45/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. show-dont-tell-pitch

**Source Pattern:** Show, Don't Tell
**Purpose:** Communicate vision by demonstration rather than description, making abstract ideas tangible and emotionally resonant.
**Trigger:** "How do I pitch this?" or "They're not understanding my vision" or "I need to get buy-in"
**Inputs:** Vision or idea to communicate, target audience, current communication approach
**Outputs:** Demonstration strategy, concrete examples, emotional hooks, presentation recommendations
**Reasoning:** Powerful communication principle but less structured than top skills. Disney's method was personal performance - harder to systematize. Valuable for pitching and vision communication but borderline on actionable structure.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 7/10 - Principle is clear but method varies by situation
- Invocable: 8/10 - Triggered by communication/pitch challenges
- Scoped: 8/10 - Focused on vision communication
- Reusable: 8/10 - Pitches, presentations, team alignment
- Valuable: 9/10 - Transforms ineffective communication

**Total: 40/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

### 6. guest-perspective-audit

**Source Pattern:** Guest Perspective First / The Disney Experience Philosophy
**Purpose:** Evaluate any experience from the user/guest perspective rather than operational or internal perspective.
**Trigger:** "Is this user-friendly?" or "Review this from the customer's perspective" or "Why aren't users happy?"
**Inputs:** Experience or product to evaluate, operational assumptions, user feedback
**Outputs:** Perspective shift analysis, pain points from guest view, "no bad show" violations, improvement recommendations
**Reasoning:** Core Disney philosophy but overlaps significantly with general UX thinking. The distinctive elements (theatrical metaphor, "onstage/backstage") add value but the core method is less uniquely Disney than other skills.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 7/10 - Clear perspective but method overlaps with UX practice
- Invocable: 8/10 - Triggered by user experience questions
- Scoped: 7/10 - Broad scope (overlaps with general UX)
- Reusable: 9/10 - Any product or experience
- Valuable: 8/10 - Valuable but not uniquely Disney

**Total: 39/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**
