| Von Neumann telling Shannon to "call it entropy" for two reasons | ⚠ DISPUTED | [EOHT](https://www.eoht.info/page/Neumann-Shannon%20anecdote), [Wikiquote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Claude_Elwood_Shannon). This story has been classified as a possible "urban legend in science." Shannon was evasive when asked about it directly. The exchange is described as "perhaps apocryphal" by some scholars. |

## Notes

- **The von Neumann "entropy" quote** is widely circulated but scholars have questioned its authenticity. The story was first publicly told by Myron Tribus in 1961 and appeared in Scientific American in 1971. Shannon himself was evasive when asked about the origins of his terminology. The quote has been classified by some as a possible "urban legend in science," though it may contain a kernel of truth.

- Shannon and Turing's WWII meeting is well-documented. They met for tea daily at Bell Labs cafeteria in early 1943 when Turing was visiting to share Bletchley Park methods. Despite both working on cryptography, they couldn't discuss their classified work with each other.

- Shannon's 1937 master's thesis is frequently cited as "the most important master's thesis of the 20th century" or "of all time" - this claim is widely accepted in the literature.

- Shannon was known for his playful inventions alongside his serious theoretical work, including unicycling through Bell Labs while juggling.
