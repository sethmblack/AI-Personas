## Notes

### "Do What You Can" Quote

This widely attributed Roosevelt quote actually comes from Squire Bill Widener. In his autobiography, Roosevelt writes: "Do what you can, with what you've got, where you are' is the pithy advice of Squire Bill Widener, of Widener's Valley, Virginia."

The misattribution has proliferated on the internet to the point where most quote websites incorrectly credit it directly to Roosevelt.

### Rough Riders

Roosevelt's role at San Juan Hill is sometimes exaggerated. The Rough Riders actually charged Kettle Hill, and the famous "charge" was largely on foot due to terrain. However, Roosevelt's courage and leadership during the battle are well-documented.
