## HIGH Priority (40+ Points)

### 1. strenuous-life-challenge

**Source Pattern:** The Strenuous Life Philosophy
**Purpose:** Transform hesitation, comfort-seeking, or fear of difficulty into decisive action through Roosevelt's framework of embracing the strenuous path.
**Trigger:** "Give me the strenuous life perspective" or "I'm afraid of failing" or "Should I take the safe path or the difficult one?"
**Inputs:** Description of decision or challenge, the comfortable/easy option, the difficult/strenuous option, fears or hesitations
**Outputs:** Assessment of which path character demands, reframe of "failure" as education, action plan for the strenuous path, warning about the consequences of choosing comfort
**Reasoning:** This is Roosevelt's core philosophy—a complete framework for decision-making when facing difficulty. Highly actionable with clear trigger and output. Saves significant time by cutting through analysis paralysis and fear-based hesitation.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Produces concrete decision guidance and action plan |
| Invocable | 9 | Clear trigger phrases, natural invocation points |

### 2. man-in-the-arena-defense

**Source Pattern:** "Citizenship in a Republic" / Man in the Arena philosophy
**Purpose:** Counter criticism, overcome fear of judgment, and reframe failure as noble effort when someone is paralyzed by the opinions of non-participants.
**Trigger:** "What about the critics?" or "I'm afraid of what people will say" or "Help me handle criticism" or "Man in the arena"
**Inputs:** The action being contemplated or taken, the criticism feared or received, the relationship of critics to the actual effort
**Outputs:** Assessment of critic legitimacy (are they in the arena?), reframe of the criticism, perspective on the value of striving vs. spectating, action recommendation
**Reasoning:** One of the most quoted passages in American oratory. Directly addresses universal fear of criticism and judgment. Clear framework: those who act vs. those who merely criticize. Highly reusable across any situation where criticism or fear of criticism creates paralysis.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear output: assessment of critic, reframe, action recommendation |

**Inputs:** Description of conflict or negotiation, your capabilities ("stick"), the relationship you want to maintain, current balance of power
**Outputs:** Assessment of current position (too soft? too aggressive?), recommended calibration, specific tactics for speaking softly, specific actions to demonstrate the stick, warning signs that rebalancing is needed
**Reasoning:** Roosevelt's most famous diplomatic maxim. Provides clear framework for situations requiring both strength and restraint. Highly applicable to negotiations, management, conflict resolution. The key insight—that both extremes fail—is immediately actionable.

| Invocable | 10 | Iconic phrase provides perfect trigger |

### 4. square-deal-arbitration

**Source Pattern:** The Square Deal Framework
**Purpose:** Adjudicate disputes or design policies that achieve genuine fairness without favoritism or class warfare.
**Trigger:** "Give me a square deal analysis" or "How do I be fair to all parties?" or "This seems unfair—help me think through it"
**Inputs:** Description of the dispute or policy question, the parties involved, their competing interests, current imbalance (if any)
**Outputs:** Assessment of what genuine fairness requires (not equality of outcome, but honest dealing), identification of crookedness or favoritism, recommended adjustments, principles for ongoing fair dealing
**Reasoning:** Roosevelt's domestic policy framework remains highly relevant for adjudicating disputes and designing fair systems. Clear criteria: no crookedness in the dealing, no favoritism, but not forced equality of outcomes. Useful for managers, mediators, policy designers.

## MEDIUM Priority (30-39 Points)

### 5. conservation-stewardship-assessment

**Purpose:** Apply Roosevelt's conservation principles to decisions involving resources, sustainability, and legacy—leaving things for "your children's children."
**Trigger:** "What would Roosevelt say about sustainability?" or "Conservation perspective on this" or "Long-term stewardship view"
**Inputs:** Resource or asset in question, competing short-term vs. long-term interests, stakeholders (present and future)
**Outputs:** Assessment of stewardship obligations, identification of exploitation vs. sustainable use, recommendations for preservation/conservation, framing in terms of intergenerational duty
**Reasoning:** Roosevelt's conservation legacy remains highly relevant. Provides framework for sustainability decisions. However, somewhat narrower application than other skills—primarily useful for environmental, resource, or legacy decisions.

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Produces stewardship assessment and recommendations |
| Invocable | 7 | Less iconic trigger than other TR phrases |
| Scoped | 8 | Single purpose: long-term stewardship |

**Trigger:** "I'm overthinking this" or "Analysis paralysis" or "Just help me act"
**Inputs:** Decision being considered, information available, information still missing, consequences of delay
**Outputs:** Assessment of whether more analysis is genuinely needed, minimum viable decision criteria, action recommendation with adjustment plan
**Reasoning:** Important principle but overlaps significantly with strenuous-life-challenge. More tactical than philosophical. Useful but partially redundant with the higher-scored skill.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Directly produces action recommendation |
| Invocable | 7 | Less distinctive trigger phrase |
| Scoped | 8 | Single purpose: breaking analysis paralysis |
