## Key Works

### Sculpture

#### Pieta (1498-1499)
Commissioned by Cardinal Jean de Billheres for St. Peter's Basilica. Michelangelo's only signed work. Carved from a single block of Carrara marble that he personally selected over nine months.

**Significance:**
- Completed when Michelangelo was only 24 years old
- Demonstrates impossible technical mastery in depicting cloth, flesh, and emotion
- Polished longer than carved--the finish itself is legendary
- Shows Mary holding the dead Christ; her youthful face represents eternal purity

#### David (1501-1504)
Carved from a block of marble that had been abandoned for 40 years after another sculptor botched the initial work. The marble was considered ruined, too shallow and flawed for a major work.

**Significance:**
- 17 feet tall, carved from the "Giant" block
- Depicts David before the battle, not after--tension and potential, not triumph
- Anatomically precise while also idealized
- Michelangelo saw the giant within the rejected stone

#### Moses (1513-1515)
Part of the ill-fated Tomb of Pope Julius II--the "tragedy of the tomb" that haunted Michelangelo for 40 years.

**Significance:**
- Exemplifies terribilita--the figure radiates power and fury
- Legend says Michelangelo struck the knee and demanded "Now speak!"
- The horns (rays of light) from Exodus mistranslation

### Painting

#### Sistine Chapel Ceiling (1508-1512)
Commissioned by Pope Julius II. Michelangelo resisted, insisting he was a sculptor, not a painter. He was forced to accept.

**Technical achievement:**
- Over 5,000 square feet of fresco
- Nine scenes from Genesis, most famously The Creation of Adam
- Over 300 figures, each anatomically precise
- Painted in buon fresco--pigment applied to wet plaster, each section completed in one day (giornata)

**Working conditions:**
- Built his own scaffold (rejected Bramante's design)
- Painted standing with head bent backward, not lying down as myths suggest
- Paint dripped in his eyes constantly
- Developed severe physical ailments; wrote a poem describing his suffering
- Worked largely alone, dismissing most assistants as incompetent

#### The Last Judgment (1536-1541)
Painted 25 years after the ceiling, on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel. Shows Christ judging souls--saints ascending, damned descending into hell.

**Significance:**
- Darker, more turbulent than the ceiling
- Controversial for its nudes; later censored with painted drapery
- Reflects Michelangelo's deepening religious preoccupation
- Shows terribilita at its most intense

### Architecture

#### St. Peter's Basilica Dome (1546-1564)
Appointed chief architect at age 71. Inherited a flawed design and resolved its structural problems.

**Achievement:**
- Refused payment--did it "for the love of God"
- Designed the dome that would become Rome's defining silhouette
- Did not live to see it completed, but his design was largely followed

#### Laurentian Library (1524-1534)
Designed for the Medici. Famous for the vestibule staircase--sculptural architecture that broke classical rules.

## Historical Context

### Florence in Michelangelo's Youth
- Lorenzo de' Medici (Lorenzo the Magnificent) ruled Florence
- Michelangelo was taken into the Medici household as a teenager
- Exposed to humanist scholars, ancient sculpture, and Neoplatonic philosophy
- After Lorenzo's death, political chaos; Savonarola's theocratic republic

### Patrons and Conflicts

#### Pope Julius II (1503-1513)
"The Warrior Pope"--ambitious, demanding, volatile. Both he and Michelangelo were described as "terribile."

- Commissioned the tomb that became Michelangelo's greatest frustration
- Forced Michelangelo to paint the Sistine ceiling instead
- The two men clashed repeatedly; Michelangelo once fled Rome in fury
- Despite conflict, Julius was the patron who enabled Michelangelo's greatest works

#### The Tragedy of the Tomb
In 1505, Julius commissioned an enormous freestanding tomb--40+ statues, a monumental structure. Michelangelo devoted months to selecting marble at Carrara.

- The project was repeatedly interrupted for other commissions
- After Julius died, his heirs demanded completion while successive popes demanded other work
- Michelangelo spent 40 years trying to fulfill this commission
- The final tomb (1545) was a reduced wall monument with only 7 statues, three by Michelangelo
- He called it "the tragedy of the tomb"

#### The Medici Popes
Leo X and Clement VII, both from the Medici family, employed Michelangelo for projects including:
- Medici Chapel tombs
- Laurentian Library
- Fortifications of Florence

Leo X described Michelangelo as "troppo terribile"--too frightening to deal with.

## Famous Quotes

### On Art and Craft
- "I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free."
- "The sculpture is already complete within the marble block, before I start my work."
- "Trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle."
- "If people knew how hard I worked to get my mastery, it would not seem so wonderful at all."
- "I am still learning."
- "The true work of art is but a shadow of the divine perfection."

### On Standards
- "The greatest danger for most of us is not that our aim is too high and we miss it, but that it is too low and we reach it."
- "A good artist ought never to allow impatience to overcome his sense of the main end of art--perfection."
- "Keep your compass in your eyes and not in your hand, for the hands execute, but the eye judges."

### On Faith and Art
- "For those who feel it, nothing makes the soul so religious and pure as the endeavor to create something perfect; for God is perfection, and whoever strives after it, is striving after something divine."
- "Art is the gift of God, and must be used unto His glory."

### On Process
- "I cannot give you something mediocre even if that is all you asked for."
- "Genius is eternal patience."

## Working Methods

### The Carving Process
Michelangelo carved from one side toward the other, as if revealing a figure emerging from water:

1. **Selection** - Months finding the perfect block; sound and appearance both mattered
2. **Rough blocking** - Remove major masses with point chisel
3. **Refinement** - Work progressively finer with claw chisels, flat chisels
4. **Revelation** - The figure emerges from the front, with back still embedded
5. **Finishing** - Rasps, files, and polishing; the Pieta was polished as long as it was carved

### The Fresco Process
For the Sistine Chapel:

1. **Cartoons** - Full-size drawings of each section
2. **Transfer** - Pouncing (pricking holes, dusting charcoal through) or incising
3. **Intonaco** - Fresh plaster applied each day (giornata)
4. **Painting** - Work quickly while plaster is wet; no corrections possible
5. **As mastery grew** - Abandoned cartoons, worked freehand directly on wet plaster

### Architectural Method
- Designed through three-dimensional clay models, not drawings alone
- Treated architecture as sculpture--forms should have the tension of living bodies
- Broke classical rules when they did not serve his vision
- Focused on structural integrity first, then expression

## Personality and Character

### Difficult Temperament
- Quick temper, contentious relationships
- Suspicious of others, feared plagiarism
- Fiercely independent--dismissed assistants repeatedly
- Lived in deliberate squalor despite substantial wealth
- "Bizzarro e fantastico"--withdrawn, melancholic

### The Rivalry with Leonardo
- 23 years younger than Leonardo da Vinci
- Public enmity between them documented
- Once mocked Leonardo publicly over an unfinished bronze horse
- Represented opposite philosophies: Leonardo the painter-scientist; Michelangelo the sculptor-prophet

### The Rivalry with Raphael
- Believed Bramante and Raphael conspired against him
- Resented Raphael's charm and social ease
- Suspected Raphael of plagiarizing from the Sistine ceiling
- Their rivalry reflected deeper tensions: grace vs. power

### Solitary Nature
- Never married
- Close friendships were intense and few
- Deep attachment to young nobleman Tommaso dei Cavalieri
- Worked alone by preference
