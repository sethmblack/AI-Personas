## HIGH Priority

### 1. hidden-form-revelation

**Source Pattern:** The Figure in the Stone / Revealing the Hidden Form
**Purpose:** Perceive and articulate the completed form within raw material, vague ideas, or unfinished work--then systematically remove what obscures it.
**Trigger:** "What is this really trying to be?" or "Help me find the essential form" or "I have a vague idea but can't see it clearly"
**Inputs:** Description of raw material (idea, project, draft, situation), current state, constraints or given elements
**Outputs:** Clear articulation of the essential form, identification of what must be removed or refined, sequence of revelatory steps
**Reasoning:** This is Michelangelo's core creative philosophy--a complete framework for creative perception and refinement. Highly reusable across creative projects, product development, writing, strategy. Transforms overwhelm into clarity by reframing creation as revelation.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear process (perceive, identify obscuring elements, remove systematically)
- Invocable: YES - natural triggers when facing creative ambiguity
- Scoped: YES - focused on revealing essential form
- Reusable: YES - applies to any creative or strategic work
- Valuable: YES - transforms creative blocks into clear action

**Score: 48/50**

### 2. masterwork-preparation

**Source Pattern:** Preparation as Mastery / Study Until It Becomes Instinct
**Purpose:** Design comprehensive preparation for ambitious projects so that execution becomes the natural expression of accumulated understanding.
**Trigger:** "How should I prepare for this major project?" or "What study do I need before I begin?" or "Design a preparation plan"
**Inputs:** Project description, timeline, current knowledge/skills, desired outcome
**Outputs:** Preparation plan covering: knowledge to acquire, skills to practice, materials to study, milestones before execution begins, criteria for readiness
**Reasoning:** Michelangelo's obsessive preparation (months selecting marble, hundreds of drawings, years of anatomical dissection) provides a model for deep preparation that enables confident execution. Prevents premature action and rework.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - produces concrete preparation plans
- Invocable: YES - triggered by major project initiation
- Scoped: YES - focused on pre-execution preparation
- Reusable: YES - applies to any ambitious undertaking
- Valuable: YES - prevents costly premature starts

**Score: 45/50**

### 3. constraint-alchemy

**Source Pattern:** The Discipline of Difficulty / The David Story
**Purpose:** Transform constraints, flawed starting conditions, and inherited failures into opportunities for mastery--finding the giant within the rejected stone.
**Trigger:** "I'm working with constraints" or "I inherited a mess" or "This material is flawed" or "Turn constraints into opportunity"
**Inputs:** Description of constraints, flaws, or inherited problems; what would success look like despite these
**Outputs:** Reframing of constraints as creative opportunities, specific approaches that use constraints constructively, identification of what only these constraints make possible
**Reasoning:** Michelangelo's David came from a 40-year-abandoned, badly botched block that others rejected. This transforms victim mentality into artistic advantage. Highly applicable to product pivots, turnarounds, limited budgets.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - produces specific reframings and approaches
- Invocable: YES - triggered by constraint discovery
- Scoped: YES - focused on constraint transformation
- Reusable: YES - universal across domains
- Valuable: YES - converts liabilities into advantages

**Score: 44/50**

### 4. terribilita-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Terribilita - Awesome Power
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether work achieves genuine impact and emotional power, or merely adequate execution--pushing toward the sublime and away from the merely pleasant.
**Trigger:** "Is this powerful enough?" or "Does this have impact?" or "Evaluate the terribilita" or "Is this too safe?"
**Inputs:** Work to evaluate (creative, strategic, communicative), intended audience, desired effect
**Outputs:** Assessment of current impact level, identification of where safety dilutes power, specific recommendations for increasing intensity while maintaining quality
**Reasoning:** Michelangelo's works provoke awe because he refused to settle for pleasant adequacy. This framework helps creators push past comfort toward genuine impact. Applicable to art, presentations, product design, communication.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - produces specific impact assessments and recommendations
- Invocable: YES - triggered by review/evaluation moments
- Scoped: YES - focused on emotional power and impact
- Reusable: YES - applies to any work intended to move audiences
- Valuable: YES - distinguishes mediocre from memorable

**Score: 42/50**

### 5. internal-compass-development

**Source Pattern:** The Compass in the Eye
**Purpose:** Develop internalized judgment so that external validation becomes unnecessary--the hands execute, but the eye judges.
**Trigger:** "How do I develop better judgment?" or "I rely too much on external feedback" or "Build my internal compass"
**Inputs:** Domain of desired mastery, current judgment level, common mistakes or uncertainties
**Outputs:** Training plan for developing internal judgment, exercises for calibrating perception, milestones indicating growing mastery
**Reasoning:** Michelangelo's principle that rules must be internalized until measurement becomes instinct. This addresses the dependency on external validation that limits creative autonomy. Crucial for creative independence.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - produces judgment development plans
- Invocable: YES - triggered by validation dependency
- Scoped: YES - focused on internal judgment cultivation
- Reusable: YES - applies across creative and professional domains
- Valuable: YES - builds lasting capability, not just solving one problem

**Score: 40/50**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 6. perfectionism-calibration

**Source Pattern:** Divine Perfectionism / Standards
**Purpose:** Distinguish productive perfectionism (pursuing genuine excellence) from destructive perfectionism (paralysis and self-torture), calibrating standards appropriately.
**Trigger:** "Am I being too perfectionist?" or "When is good enough actually good enough?" or "Calibrate my standards"
**Inputs:** Project context, current standards being applied, symptoms (paralysis, endless revision, etc.)
**Outputs:** Assessment of whether perfectionism is productive or destructive, recommended standard adjustment, specific criteria for "done"
**Reasoning:** Michelangelo pursued perfection relentlessly but also completed works. This framework helps distinguish between his productive terribilita and unproductive paralysis. Addresses common creative struggle.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - produces specific calibrations
- Invocable: YES - triggered by perfectionism struggles
- Scoped: YES - focused on standard-setting
- Reusable: YES - universal creative challenge
- Valuable: MODERATE - helpful but more diagnostic than transformative

**Score: 36/50**

### 7. patron-management

**Source Pattern:** Patron Relationships / The Tragedy of the Tomb
**Purpose:** Navigate difficult patron/stakeholder relationships while protecting creative vision and managing competing demands.
**Trigger:** "My client/boss/patron is making impossible demands" or "How do I manage this stakeholder conflict?"
**Inputs:** Patron demands, creative vision, constraints, history of relationship
**Outputs:** Assessment of the power dynamics, recommended negotiation approach, boundary-setting strategies, when to comply vs. resist
**Reasoning:** Michelangelo managed the most powerful patrons of his era (multiple Popes, the Medici) while maintaining artistic integrity. His "tragedy of the tomb" shows both successes and costs of these negotiations.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - produces negotiation strategies
- Invocable: YES - triggered by patron conflicts
- Scoped: YES - focused on patron/stakeholder management
- Reusable: YES - applies to any creative-patron relationship
- Valuable: MODERATE - useful but less unique to Michelangelo

**Score: 34/50**
