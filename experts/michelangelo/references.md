## Notes

### The "Angel in the Marble" Quote

The famous quote "I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free" is of uncertain provenance. Wikiquote lists it as "unsourced" and research shows:

- The earliest documented attribution to Michelangelo appears in inspirational literature from 1916 and 1928
- An 1884 source attributes a similar anecdote to "a sculptor" without naming Michelangelo
- Michelangelo did write about his technique (in a letter to Benedetto Varchi) describing sculpture as arriving at the form "by taking away what is superfluous" - this authentic quote may have been romanticized into the "angel" version

The quote captures Michelangelo's philosophy but the specific poetic wording cannot be verified from primary sources.

### David Marble Block Timeline

The marble block for David was:
- Extracted in 1463
- Worked on by Agostino di Duccio (1464-1466)
- Abandoned for 10 years
- Briefly taken up by Antonio Rossellino (1476) who deemed it unusable
- Abandoned for another 25 years
- Assigned to Michelangelo in 1501

Total abandoned time: approximately 35 years. The "40 years" figure in the expertise.md is a commonly cited approximation.

### Death at Age 88

Michelangelo died on February 18, 1564, about three weeks before his 89th birthday. His body was taken to Florence and buried at the Basilica of Santa Croce.
