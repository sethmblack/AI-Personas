## Evaluation Summary

Note: The existing `vulnerability-as-leadership` skill (Oprah Winfrey expert) has ~30% overlap with Brene's vulnerability concepts but differs in framing and application. The existing `honest-feedback-framework` skill (Anthony Bourdain expert) has ~25% overlap with "clear is kind" but uses kitchen-style directness vs. Brene's rumbling approach. Both Brene-specific skills below are sufficiently distinct.

## HIGH Priority

### 1. rumble-conversation

**Source Pattern:** What is a "Rumble"? / Clear Is Kind: The Difficult Conversations Framework
**Purpose:** Structure and facilitate a difficult conversation using Brene Brown's rumbling methodology - leaning into vulnerability, staying curious, owning your part, and achieving clarity without blame
**Trigger:** "I need to have a difficult conversation" / "How do I give feedback without shaming?" / "We need to rumble on this" / Conflict or tension requiring resolution
**Inputs:**
- The issue to address
- The relationship context
- What you're making up (SFD)
- Your part in the situation
- Desired outcome
**Outputs:**
- Pre-rumble preparation (checking your SFD, owning your part)
- Conversation structure with opening frame
- Specific language options ("say more," "help me understand")
- Clear-is-kind feedback formulation
- Post-rumble reflection prompts
**Reasoning:** This is Brene's most actionable framework with clear 6-step process (engaged feedback elements), specific vocabulary, and high reuse across any interpersonal tension. Differentiates from `honest-feedback-framework` by emphasizing vulnerability, SFD examination, and rumbling methodology rather than kitchen-style directness. Used 3+ times weekly in any team setting, saves 30+ minutes of preparation and potential conflict escalation.

### 2. trust-assessment-braving

**Source Pattern:** The BRAVING Trust Inventory
**Purpose:** Diagnose trust issues in a relationship or team using the BRAVING framework (Boundaries, Reliability, Accountability, Vault, Integrity, Non-judgment, Generosity) and identify specific actions to repair or build trust
**Trigger:** "I don't trust this person/team" / "Trust has broken down" / "How do I rebuild trust?" / Interpersonal friction without clear cause
**Inputs:**
- The relationship or team to assess
- Current trust concerns or incidents
- Context (professional/personal)
**Outputs:**
- BRAVING component assessment (which elements are strong/weak)
- Specific incidents mapped to BRAVING components
- Trust repair actions for each weak component
- Marble jar analysis (small moments that build/erode trust)
**Reasoning:** Clear 7-component diagnostic framework with concrete definitions. Highly reusable across any relationship. Different from existing `trust-based-resource-allocation` skill which focuses on organizational resource decisions, not interpersonal trust diagnosis. High value in post-incident reviews, team friction, partnership breakdowns. Estimated 2+ uses/week in leadership contexts.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 3. shame-resilience-check

**Source Pattern:** Shame Resilience Theory / Shame vs Guilt Distinction
**Purpose:** When someone is experiencing shame (or shaming others), diagnose whether it's shame vs guilt, apply the four elements of shame resilience, and guide toward connection rather than disconnection
**Trigger:** "I feel like a failure" / "What's wrong with me?" / "You should have known better" / Post-failure spiraling / Blame dynamics in retrospectives
**Inputs:**
- The situation triggering shame
- The internal narrative being experienced
- The relationship/team context
**Outputs:**
- Shame vs guilt diagnosis
- Shame trigger identification
- Empathy-based response (antidote to shame)
- Speaking shame guidance (how to name it)
- Connection-building next steps
**Reasoning:** Four clear elements (recognize triggers, critical awareness, reaching out, speaking shame) with high value in post-incident reviews and failure scenarios. Tech culture is particularly shame-prone (imposter syndrome, public failures). Estimated 1-2 uses/week, saves emotional spiraling and blame dynamics. 5 steps but some are internal/reflective.

### 4. rising-strong-process

**Source Pattern:** The Rising Strong Process
**Purpose:** Guide someone through getting back up after a setback using the three-stage Reckoning-Rumble-Revolution framework, with special attention to the SFD (story we make up) and writing a new ending
**Trigger:** "I failed" / "How do I recover from this?" / After a significant setback / Post-incident emotional processing / Career disappointment
**Inputs:**
- The failure or setback
- The emotions being experienced
- The story being made up (SFD)
- What actually happened
**Outputs:**
- Reckoning guidance (emotional recognition)
- SFD identification and reality-check
- Rumble questions (challenging the story)
- Revolution framing (new ending, integrated learning)
- Action steps for showing up differently
**Reasoning:** Clear 3-stage process with specific SFD methodology. High value after incidents, project failures, career setbacks. Complements but differs from shame-resilience-check by focusing on recovery process rather than diagnosis. Estimated 1-2 uses/week in environments with regular failures (which is all of tech). 4-5 steps depending on granularity.

## LOW Priority

None identified. All patterns either meet HIGH/MEDIUM criteria or are better as reference material.

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Empathy vs Sympathy | Reference knowledge/distinction, not actionable workflow; works as a table in expertise.md |
| Atlas of the Heart (87 Emotions) | Reference material for emotional vocabulary; too broad for single skill |
| Ten Guideposts for Wholehearted Living | Philosophical/lifestyle framework, not invocable workflow |
| Armored vs Daring Leadership | Reference table/self-assessment, not triggered workflow |
| Four Skill Sets of Courage | Meta-framework describing the skill areas, not a skill itself |
| Strong Back, Soft Front, Wild Heart | Philosophical principle, not actionable process |
| Living Into Values exercise | Could become a skill but is essentially "name 2 values and operationalize" - simpler guidance than full skill |
| FFT (F***ing First Time) | Normalization concept, not workflow - single insight not requiring steps |
| Biographical/Research Methodology | Reference material, not actionable |
