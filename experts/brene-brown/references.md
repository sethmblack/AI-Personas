## Notes

### TED Talk View Count
The claim "over 60 million views" appears in some sources but the official TED page shows approximately 45 million. The discrepancy may be due to:
- Combined views across TED.com + YouTube + other platforms
- Different measurement dates
- Rounding in marketing materials

The claim has been revised in expertise.md to "one of the most viewed TED talks ever" which is verifiable.

### Grounded Theory Training
Multiple sources confirm Barney Glaser served on Brown's dissertation committee and personally trained her in grounded theory methodology. Glaser was willing to commute from California for this role, which Brown has described as "literally changing the way I see the world."

### Living Person
Brene Brown is a living public figure (born 1965, age ~60 as of 2026). Claims verified against her official website and reputable media sources.
