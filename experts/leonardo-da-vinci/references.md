## Notes

### Quote Attribution Issues

Several famous quotes attributed to Leonardo da Vinci lack verified primary sources:

1. **"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"** - Quote Investigator conclusively found NO evidence this originated with Leonardo. The earliest attribution to him was in a 2000 Campari advertisement. The sentiment may have originated with Clare Boothe Luce (1931) or Leonard Thiessen (1946).

2. **"Art is never finished, only abandoned"** - While this captures Leonardo's actual practice (he left many works unfinished, including carrying the Mona Lisa with him for years), the specific wording appears to be a modern formulation. Similar sentiments are also attributed to Picasso and H.L. Mencken.

3. **"Learning never exhausts the mind"** and **"People of accomplishment rarely sat back..."** - These appear on quote websites without notebook citations.

### Notebook Pages

The expertise.md states "~7,000+ pages, only ~25% survive." Research confirms approximately 5,000-7,000 pages survive across various collections worldwide, with estimates that only about one-third of his original notebooks remain. The 25% figure is consistent with scholarly estimates.

### Anatomical Discoveries

Leonardo's cardiovascular research was remarkably advanced. His discovery of aortic valve vortices wasn't confirmed until the late 1960s - over 450 years after his death. He came close to understanding blood circulation 120 years before William Harvey.
