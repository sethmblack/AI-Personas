## HIGH Priority

### 1. cross-domain-synthesis

**Source Pattern:** Cross-Domain Analogies / The Connection Method
**Purpose:** Discover solutions by finding structural patterns shared between seemingly unrelated domains
**Trigger:** "How can I think about this differently?" or "What analogies could help here?" or when a problem is stuck
**Inputs:** Problem description, current domain, optional list of domains to explore
**Outputs:** Identified analogies, pattern mappings between domains, reframed problem statement, candidate solutions from analogous domains
**Reasoning:** Leonardo's core genius was seeing connections others missed (water/hair, trees/vessels). This is a clear 5+ step process: identify the problem structure, search for analogous structures in other domains, map the analogy, extract insights, apply to original problem. High reuse across technical design, troubleshooting, and innovation work. Estimated 2-3 uses/week for architects and senior engineers. Saves 30+ minutes of stuck thinking.

### 2. observational-debugging

**Source Pattern:** Saper Vedere / Dimostrazione / Anatomical Studies Method
**Purpose:** Diagnose system problems through rigorous observation before hypothesis, following Leonardo's "experience first, then reasoning"
**Trigger:** "What's actually happening here?" or "I can't figure out this bug" or system behaving unexpectedly
**Inputs:** System or problem description, available observability tools/logs, initial assumptions to question
**Outputs:** Observation log (what was seen vs. assumed), prioritized hypotheses, verification experiments, root cause analysis
**Reasoning:** Leonardo's anatomical method—sequential views, multiple angles, layer-by-layer analysis—maps directly to debugging complex systems. The key insight is observation before theorizing. 5-step workflow: gather raw observations, compare observations to assumptions, generate hypotheses from discrepancies, design verification tests, iterate. Used multiple times per week in any operational environment. Saves 30+ minutes by avoiding hypothesis-first debugging rabbit holes.

### 3. sfumato-decision-making

**Source Pattern:** Sfumato Philosophy / Embracing Ambiguity
**Purpose:** Make progress on decisions when information is incomplete or ambiguous, without forcing false certainty
**Trigger:** "I need to decide but don't have enough information" or "This situation is unclear" or premature certainty is blocking progress
**Inputs:** Decision to be made, available information, uncertainties/unknowns, constraints on waiting
**Outputs:** Explicit uncertainty map, reversible vs. irreversible decision elements, staged decision approach, monitoring triggers for revision
**Reasoning:** Leonardo's sfumato principle—"a willingness to embrace ambiguity, paradox, and uncertainty"—is directly applicable to technical decision-making under uncertainty. Clear 4-step process: map what is known/unknown, identify reversible vs. irreversible elements, make reversible decisions while gathering data on irreversible ones, set triggers for revision. Estimated 1-2 uses/week for technical leaders. Saves 20+ minutes of circular debate and reduces decision paralysis.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. reverse-engineering-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Reverse Engineering Nature / Anatomical Studies Method
**Purpose:** Understand complex systems by systematically dissecting them layer by layer
**Trigger:** "How does this actually work?" or "I need to understand this legacy system" or approaching unfamiliar architecture
**Inputs:** System to analyze, access level (read/execute/modify), documentation availability
**Outputs:** Layered system diagram, component interaction map, identified principles/patterns, documentation of discoveries
**Reasoning:** Leonardo's anatomical approach—sequential views, exploded diagrams, layer-by-layer stripping—maps to understanding complex technical systems. 4-step process: establish scope and access, create outer view, progressively expose layers, document interactions and principles. Estimated 1-2 uses/week for engineers working with legacy or unfamiliar systems. Saves 20-30 minutes of ad-hoc exploration.

### 5. notebook-knowledge-capture

**Source Pattern:** The Notebooks: Methodology / Documentation Imperative
**Purpose:** Create and maintain personal/team knowledge bases that enable cross-domain synthesis over time
**Trigger:** "How should I document this?" or "I keep learning things and forgetting them" or building team knowledge systems
**Inputs:** Knowledge domain, capture frequency, intended uses, collaboration requirements
**Outputs:** Notebook structure template, capture workflow, cross-referencing system, review/synthesis schedule
**Reasoning:** Leonardo's 7,000+ pages of notes over 40 years represent the premier example of systematic knowledge capture enabling later synthesis. 4-step process: establish structure (multi-domain pages), define capture workflow (observation-annotation integration), create cross-referencing system, schedule synthesis reviews. Estimated 1 use/week for setup, ongoing daily use. Moderate time savings but high long-term compounding value.

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| The Seven Principles (Curiosita, etc.) | Philosophical framework, not actionable workflow. Better as reference material. |
| Signature Quotes | Reference material for voice adoption, not procedural skill. |
| Anti-Patterns Leonardo Would Critique | Warning list, not actionable workflow. Stays as expertise reference. |
| The Flying Machine Lesson | Single illustrative example/story, not repeatable process. |
| Mirror Writing | Historical curiosity, no technical application. |
| Working with Other Experts | Integration guidance, not standalone skill. |
