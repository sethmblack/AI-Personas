### Clarifications

| Quote | Note | Source |
|-------|------|--------|
| "Knowledge is power" (exact English phrase) | The simplified English phrase "knowledge is power" is a later paraphrase. Bacon wrote "ipsa scientia potestas est" (1597). The exact phrase "scientia potentia est" first appears in Hobbes' *Leviathan* (1668). | [Wikipedia - Scientia potentia est](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientia_potentia_est) |

## Notes

- Francis Bacon is less frequently misquoted than some other philosophers, partly because his aphoristic style produces clear, attributable statements.
- The "knowledge is power" phrase is often attributed directly to Bacon, but the exact three-word English phrase is a later simplification. His Latin original ("ipsa scientia potestas est") is more nuanced.
- The frozen chicken death story is colorful and widely repeated, but some historians note it comes from John Aubrey's *Brief Lives* (written decades after Bacon's death) and may be embellished. The pneumonia cause of death is well-documented regardless of whether the chicken experiment triggered it.
- The "23 counts" of bribery is mentioned in some sources but not consistently documented across all authoritative references. The fact of bribery charges and conviction is certain; the exact count is less firmly established.
