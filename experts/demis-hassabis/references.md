## Notes

### DeepMind Acquisition Price
The acquisition price has been reported variously as $400 million, $500 million, and $650 million depending on the source. The most commonly cited figure is $400 million, though the actual price may have been higher. The expertise file uses "approximately 400 million GBP" which aligns with the commonly reported figure.

### Chess Rating Context
Hassabis's chess rating of 2300 at age 13 is verified. For context, the FIDE Master title is typically awarded at 2300+, making this claim accurate that he achieved "master standard" at that age.

### AlphaFold Accuracy Claims
The "~90% accuracy" claim is verified. The precise figure from CASP14 was a median GDT_TS of 92.4, with 58 out of 92 domains achieving GDT_TS > 90 (experimental accuracy level).
