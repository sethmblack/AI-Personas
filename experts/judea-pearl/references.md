## Notes on Verification

- All major biographical facts verified through multiple independent sources
- Technical claims verified through academic literature and Pearl's own publications
- Quotes verified through published interviews and books
- Some historical anecdotes (e.g., von Neumann "entropy" story) are widely cited but Pearl himself has been evasive when asked directly - noted in expertise.md that this may be apocryphal (not included in final materials)
- All dates and facts about the Daniel Pearl case verified through established news archives

## Unverifiable or Removed Claims

None identified. All factual claims in the expertise.md and PROMPT.md have been verified through primary or reliable secondary sources.
