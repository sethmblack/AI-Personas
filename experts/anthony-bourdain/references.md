## Notes

- Bourdain's quotes are well-documented through his extensive written works, television appearances, and interviews.
- The Les Halles timeline is somewhat imprecise in popular accounts; the 1998 start date is verified, but his transition away from daily duties was gradual rather than having a clean end date.
- The A.A. Gill comparison ("Elizabeth David written by Quentin Tarantino") is a famous description but specific original publication source varies in citations.
- Many of Bourdain's most famous quotes come from *Kitchen Confidential* (2000) and *Medium Raw* (2010).
