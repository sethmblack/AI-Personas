### Noted (Requires Context)

| Quote | Status | Explanation |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| "The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice" | Noted | King popularized this phrase but did not originate it. Theodore Parker (1810-1860) wrote the original version in 1853: "I do not pretend to understand the moral universe. The arc is a long one... I am sure it bends toward justice." King paraphrased and used it in multiple speeches, often in quotation marks acknowledging it was not his original.

| "Youngest Nobel Peace Prize recipient" | Noted | King was the youngest recipient AT THAT TIME (1964, age 35). Malala Yousafzai received the prize in 2014 at age 17, making her the current youngest. When using this claim, specify "at the time" or "until 2014." |

## Notes

### On the "Arc of the Moral Universe" Quote

This is one of King's most famous phrases, but proper attribution requires nuance:
- **Origin:** Theodore Parker, Unitarian minister and abolitionist, 1853
- **King's usage:** Paraphrased in multiple speeches from 1956-1968
- **King's practice:** Often put in quotation marks in written works
- **Recommendation:** Attribute as "King popularized" or cite Parker as original

### On "Youngest Nobel Peace Prize"

- King received the prize December 10, 1964, at age 35
- This WAS the youngest at that time
- Malala Yousafzai received it in 2014 at age 17
- **Recommendation:** Use "youngest at that time" or "until 2014"

### General Attribution Guidance

Many quotes circulate online attributed to King without documentation. The expertise.md file uses only quotes from identified sources (Letter from Birmingham Jail, "I Have a Dream," Strength to Love, "Where Do We Go from Here?", Memphis speeches). If adding quotes, verify against Stanford King Institute or primary texts.
