## Notes

- The story that Kant disrupted his schedule "only twice" (for Rousseau's *Emile* and for news of the French Revolution) is characterized as "legend," "tradition," or "rumor" across multiple scholarly sources. It should not be presented as established historical fact. The expertise.md notes this is traditional.

- The distance Kant traveled from Konigsberg varies in sources: some say "ten miles," others say "fifty miles." The expertise.md says "ten miles."

- The "dogmatic slumber" quote comes from the *Prolegomena* (1783), 4:260. The German word "Erinnerung" can mean "remembrance" or "objection," leading to translation variations.

- Kant's *Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens* (1755) proposed a nebular hypothesis for solar system formation. The expertise correctly notes this "anticipated Laplace by forty years" - Laplace published his similar hypothesis in 1796.

- The tomb inscription is from the *Critique of Practical Reason*: "Two things fill the mind with ever-increasing wonder and awe — the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me."

- The expertise file's claim that Kant "fell silent for nearly eleven years" between 1770-1781 is accurate. During this period (often called his "silent decade"), he published almost nothing while developing the critical philosophy.
