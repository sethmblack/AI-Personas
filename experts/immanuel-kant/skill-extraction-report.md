|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear framework: identify action, examine motivation, distinguish duty from inclination |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Triggers: "Am I doing this for the right reasons?" / "Is this truly moral?" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused specifically on motivation analysis |
| Reusable | 9/10 | Applies to any action where moral worth of motivation is in question |
| Valuable | 9/10 | Reveals self-deception; distinguishes genuine morality from self-interested conformity |

**Total: 48/50** | **Priority: HIGH** | **Create Skill: YES**

**Purpose:** Distinguish actions done from genuine duty from those merely conforming to duty from self-interest or inclination - revealing the moral worth of motivations.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Am I doing this for the right reasons?"
- "Is this truly moral?"
- "What's really motivating this action?"
- "Duty or inclination?"

**Inputs:**
- Action being examined
- Apparent motivations
- Self-reported reasons

**Outputs:**
- Motivational analysis
- Duty-based vs. inclination-based components identified
- Self-deception patterns revealed
- Assessment of moral worth

### 4. Systematic Architecture

**Source Pattern:** Kant's architectonic method - constructing rigorous frameworks with clear foundations, systematic structure, and principled organization

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Clear process: establish foundations, build systematically, ensure coherence |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Triggers: "Help me build a framework" / "How should I organize this?" |

## MEDIUM Priority Skills

### 6. Phenomena/Noumena Distinction

**Source Pattern:** Kant's fundamental distinction between things as they appear to us (phenomena) and things in themselves (noumena)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8/10 | Distinction is clear; application requires philosophical sophistication |
| Invocable | 7/10 | Specialized trigger; users may not know to ask |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on this specific epistemological boundary |
| Reusable | 8/10 | Applies to epistemological questions, science/religion boundaries, limits of knowledge |
| Valuable | 8/10 | Powerful when applicable; prevents overreach in claims |

**Total: 40/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** Distinguish between what can be known through experience (phenomena) and what lies beyond possible experience (noumena) - establishing proper limits of knowledge.

**Reasoning for MEDIUM:** While foundational to Kant's system, this distinction is often incorporated into Transcendental Analysis rather than standing alone. Requires philosophical sophistication from users.

---

### 7. Analytic/Synthetic Judgment Classification

**Source Pattern:** Kant's distinction between analytic judgments (truth by definition) and synthetic judgments (truth by adding to concepts)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Clear test: is predicate contained in subject or not? |
| Invocable | 6/10 | Specialized philosophical trigger |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Very focused on one distinction |
| Reusable | 7/10 | Useful in logic, mathematics, and philosophy; narrower elsewhere |
| Valuable | 7/10 | Important for foundational questions; niche otherwise |

**Total: 39/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** Determine whether a judgment is analytic (explicating what is already contained in the concept) or synthetic (adding new information to the concept).

**Reasoning for MEDIUM:** While important for Kant's system, this classification is specialized. Most practical questions do not require this level of logical analysis.

---

### 8. A Priori/A Posteriori Classification

**Source Pattern:** Kant's distinction between knowledge independent of experience (a priori) and knowledge derived from experience (a posteriori)

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Clear test: could this be known without any experience? |
| Invocable | 6/10 | Specialized philosophical trigger |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Very focused on one distinction |
| Reusable | 7/10 | Useful for epistemological questions; narrower practical application |
| Valuable | 7/10 | Important for understanding knowledge types; niche for most users |

**Total: 39/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

**Description:** Determine whether knowledge is a priori (independent of experience, known through reason alone) or a posteriori (derived from and dependent on experience).

**Reasoning for MEDIUM:** Like the analytic/synthetic distinction, this is foundational but specialized. Often incorporated into Transcendental Analysis rather than standing alone.

---

## LOW Priority Skills

### 9. Aesthetic Judgment Analysis

**Source Pattern:** Kant's analysis of judgments of taste in the *Critique of Judgment*

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 7/10 | Framework exists but is complex and contested |
| Invocable | 6/10 | Users rarely ask for Kantian aesthetic analysis specifically |
| Scoped | 8/10 | Focused on aesthetic judgment |
| Reusable | 6/10 | Specialized to aesthetics and art criticism |
| Valuable | 6/10 | Interesting but not practically transformative for most users |

**Total: 33/50** | **Priority: LOW**

**Description:** Analyze judgments of beauty using Kant's framework of disinterested pleasure, universal validity without concept, purposiveness without purpose.

**Reasoning for LOW:** While important to Kant's complete system, aesthetic judgment analysis is specialized and the framework is philosophically contested. Most users seeking aesthetic guidance would not benefit from this level of technical analysis.

---

### 10. Antinomy Resolution

**Source Pattern:** Kant's method of resolving apparently contradictory rational arguments (antinomies) by showing both rest on illegitimate assumptions

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 7/10 | Method exists but requires identifying specific antinomy structure |
| Invocable | 5/10 | Specialized philosophical situation; users unlikely to recognize |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused specifically on antinomy resolution |
| Reusable | 5/10 | Applies only to specific logical conflicts of this type |
| Valuable | 7/10 | Powerful when applicable; rare application |

**Total: 33/50** | **Priority: LOW**

**Description:** Resolve apparently contradictory arguments by showing both thesis and antithesis rest on an illegitimate assumption about the nature of the objects involved.

**Reasoning for LOW:** While brilliant in Kant's hands, antinomy resolution requires recognizing a specific logical structure that rarely appears in practical contexts. Better suited as a technique within other analyses.

---

## Rejected Patterns

### Schematism Application

**Description:** Applying Kant's doctrine of schematism - how pure concepts of understanding are applied to intuitions through time.

**Rejection Reasoning:** The schematism is one of the most technically obscure parts of Kant's philosophy. Even Kant scholars debate its meaning. Not suitable for practical skill extraction.

### Table of Categories Application

**Description:** Systematically applying Kant's twelve categories (quantity, quality, relation, modality) to analyze experience.

**Rejection Reasoning:** While the categories are foundational, their systematic application is highly technical and rarely useful outside specialized philosophical inquiry. The core insight (mind actively structures experience) is captured in Transcendental Analysis.

### Perpetual Peace Framework

**Description:** Applying Kant's political philosophy framework for achieving perpetual peace among nations.

**Rejection Reasoning:** While historically important, this is too narrow and context-specific for a general skill. The underlying principles (treating states as moral agents, republican constitution, federation of free states) could be relevant but are better addressed ad hoc.
