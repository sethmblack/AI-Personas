## HIGH Priority

### 1. strategic-inflection-point-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** Strategic Inflection Points / 10X Forces / "Fire Yourself" Test
**Purpose:** Diagnose whether a business challenge represents a strategic inflection point requiring fundamental transformation, or a normal problem requiring incremental improvement.
**Trigger:** "Is this a fundamental change?", "Our industry is being disrupted", "Nothing we do seems to work anymore", "Everything is changing"
**Inputs:** Business situation, competitive landscape, performance trends, industry changes, customer behavior shifts
**Outputs:** Inflection point diagnosis (yes/no/emerging), 10X force identification, transformation recommendations, commitment assessment
**Reasoning:** Grove's inflection point framework is his most distinctive and valuable contribution. It provides a structured way to distinguish transformational threats from normal challenges, preventing both under-reaction (incremental fixes to existential threats) and over-reaction (panic to normal fluctuations).

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES (10/10) - Clear diagnostic questions, 10X force analysis framework, fire-yourself test
- Invocable: YES (10/10) - Natural triggers when facing disruption, declining performance, competitive shifts
- Scoped: YES (9/10) - Strategic diagnosis; boundary with implementation is clear
- Reusable: YES (10/10) - Any industry, any company size, any strategic challenge
- Valuable: YES (10/10) - Prevents existential miscategorization; saves companies

**Score: 49/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

### 2. high-output-management-audit

**Source Pattern:** Manager's Output / Leverage / Task-Relevant Maturity / Process Thinking
**Purpose:** Audit a manager or organization's effectiveness through Grove's output-based management framework, identifying leverage points and removing bottlenecks.
**Trigger:** "How do I become more effective?", "My team isn't producing", "I'm working hard but not getting results", "We need to improve organizational performance"
**Inputs:** Management activities, team structure, current outputs, time allocation, decision-making processes
**Outputs:** Output assessment, leverage analysis, limiting step identification, task-relevant maturity evaluation, recommendations
**Reasoning:** High Output Management provides the most systematic framework for managerial effectiveness. It transforms vague productivity concerns into measurable, improvable processes.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES (10/10) - Output equation, leverage multipliers, limiting step analysis are clear steps
- Invocable: YES (9/10) - Management effectiveness questions trigger naturally
- Scoped: YES (9/10) - Organizational and managerial effectiveness; not individual contributor work
- Reusable: YES (10/10) - Any manager, any team, any organization
- Valuable: YES (10/10) - Transforms managerial effectiveness from art to engineering

**Score: 48/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

### 3. 10x-force-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The 10X Force Framework / Six Categories of Change
**Purpose:** Analyze whether changes in competition, technology, customers, suppliers, complementors, or regulation represent 10X forces that could trigger strategic inflection points.
**Trigger:** "Is this change significant?", "A new competitor is emerging", "Technology is changing our industry", "Customer behavior is shifting"
**Inputs:** Change description, category of change, historical baseline, industry norms
**Outputs:** 10X determination, force category identification, timeline assessment, recommended response urgency
**Reasoning:** The 10X framework provides specific criteria for evaluating the magnitude of change. It prevents both dismissing existential threats as minor and panicking over incremental shifts.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES (10/10) - Six clear categories, order-of-magnitude test, comparison to baseline
- Invocable: YES (9/10) - Disruption discussions trigger naturally
- Scoped: YES (10/10) - External force evaluation only; distinct from response planning
- Reusable: YES (10/10) - Any industry, any type of change
- Valuable: YES (9/10) - Critical categorization that determines strategy

**Score: 48/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

### 4. okr-framework

**Source Pattern:** OKR Methodology / Objectives and Key Results
**Purpose:** Implement objectives and key results for goal-setting, alignment, and execution tracking.
**Trigger:** "How do we set goals?", "Our team isn't aligned", "We need better execution tracking", "Our annual planning isn't working"
**Inputs:** Strategic priorities, time horizon, team/organization scope, current goals (if any)
**Outputs:** Well-formed OKRs, cascade structure, measurement approach, cycle recommendations
**Reasoning:** OKRs are Grove's most widely adopted contribution. The methodology is well-defined, teachable, and proven across organizations from startups to Google. Highly actionable with immediate applicability.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES (10/10) - Clear format, specific rules, defined cycles
- Invocable: YES (10/10) - Goal-setting and alignment questions trigger directly
- Scoped: YES (9/10) - Goal-setting and tracking; distinct from strategic direction
- Reusable: YES (10/10) - Any organization, any team, any level
- Valuable: YES (9/10) - Transforms vague goals into measurable outcomes

**Score: 48/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. constructive-confrontation-culture

**Source Pattern:** Constructive Confrontation / Intel Culture
**Purpose:** Evaluate and build organizational culture where the best argument wins regardless of hierarchy, and conflict is channeled productively.
**Trigger:** "Our culture avoids conflict", "Politics trumps logic", "People won't speak up", "Bad news doesn't travel upward"
**Inputs:** Current culture description, decision-making processes, feedback patterns, hierarchy dynamics
**Outputs:** Culture diagnosis, constructive confrontation principles, implementation recommendations, Cassandra channel design
**Reasoning:** Grove's culture principles are valuable but more contextual than his strategic and operational frameworks. Implementation depends heavily on organizational context and leadership commitment.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: MODERATE (7/10) - Principles are clear, but culture change is complex
- Invocable: YES (9/10) - Culture and communication problems trigger naturally
- Scoped: YES (8/10) - Organizational culture; somewhat overlaps with other culture methodologies
- Reusable: YES (8/10) - Applicable broadly but requires adaptation
- Valuable: MODERATE (8/10) - Important but harder to implement than operational skills

**Score: 40/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

---

### 6. fire-yourself-test

**Source Pattern:** "If we got kicked out..." Conversation
**Purpose:** Break emotional attachment to failing strategies by imagining what a new leader without baggage would do.
**Trigger:** "We can't abandon this strategy", "We've invested too much to change", "This is our core business", "But we've always done it this way"
**Inputs:** Current strategy, emotional attachments, sunk costs, historical context
**Outputs:** Detached analysis, recommended action, sunk cost identification, commitment assessment
**Reasoning:** The fire-yourself test is a powerful mental model but is narrow in scope. It's most valuable as a component of strategic-inflection-point-diagnosis rather than a standalone skill.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES (9/10) - Clear thought exercise with specific framing
- Invocable: YES (8/10) - Triggered by attachment/sunk cost language
- Scoped: NARROW (6/10) - Single technique; often subsumed by larger analysis
- Reusable: YES (8/10) - Any strategic stalemate situation
- Valuable: MODERATE (7/10) - Powerful but narrow; best as component

**Score: 38/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

## Skill Interaction Map

```
strategic-inflection-point-diagnosis
           |
           |-- uses --> 10x-force-analysis (to identify forces)
           |
           |-- triggers --> high-output-management-audit (for execution)
                                       |
                                       |-- implements --> okr-framework (for goals)
```

The strategic inflection point diagnosis is the primary entry point. If it identifies an inflection point, it may call 10X force analysis for deeper understanding. Once strategy is set, high-output-management-audit ensures execution capability, which implements OKRs for measurement and alignment.
