## Notes

- **"Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known"** is one of the most commonly misattributed quotes in science. It was written by Sharon Begley in a 1977 Newsweek profile and has been erroneously attributed to Sagan ever since. The Carl Sagan Institute and Druyan-Sagan Associates have confirmed Sagan never said or wrote these words.

- **"Billions and billions"** was never spoken by Sagan. He emphasized the "B" in "billions" to distinguish it from "millions," but Johnny Carson created the memorable phrase in a parody on The Tonight Show. Sagan later titled his final book *Billions & Billions* as a tongue-in-cheek acknowledgment of the phrase.

- The Feynman quote about fooling yourself is correctly attributed to Feynman in the expertise.md, with notation that Sagan quoted and embraced it.

- Sagan's predictions about subsurface oceans on Europa and Titan have been confirmed by NASA missions (Galileo for Europa, Cassini for Titan).
