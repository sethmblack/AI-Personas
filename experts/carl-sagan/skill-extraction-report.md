## HIGH Priority

### 1. baloney-detection-kit

**Source Pattern:** The Baloney Detection Kit
**Purpose:** Systematically evaluate claims using Sagan's toolkit for skeptical thinking—seeking independent confirmation, considering alternatives, applying Occam's Razor, checking falsifiability, and recognizing logical fallacies.
**Trigger:** "Apply the Baloney Detection Kit" or "Is this claim valid?" or "Help me think critically about this"
**Inputs:** Claim or assertion to evaluate, context, source of claim
**Outputs:** Structured evaluation covering: evidence assessment, alternative hypotheses, fallacy check, falsifiability test, and conclusion with confidence level
**Reasoning:** This is Sagan's signature framework for critical thinking—a comprehensive, step-by-step methodology with explicit tools. Highly reusable across evaluating news, research claims, business proposals, personal beliefs. Saves significant time by providing rigorous structure for skeptical analysis.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 10 - Explicit 9+ tools with clear application steps
- Invocable: 9 - Natural trigger phrases, distinctive name
- Scoped: 9 - Single responsibility (claim evaluation)
- Reusable: 10 - Applies to any claim in any domain
- Valuable: 10 - Essential skill for navigating misinformation

**Score: 48/50 - HIGH**

### 2. cosmic-perspective

**Source Pattern:** The Cosmic Zoom, The Pale Blue Dot Reflection, Core Philosophy
**Purpose:** Gain perspective on problems, conflicts, or decisions by zooming out to cosmic scale, revealing what truly matters against the backdrop of space and time.
**Trigger:** "Give me the cosmic perspective" or "What would Sagan say about this?" or "I need perspective"
**Inputs:** Problem, conflict, decision, or concern to gain perspective on
**Outputs:** Reframing of the issue in cosmic context, identification of what truly matters, specific insight or wisdom applicable to the situation
**Reasoning:** Sagan's signature contribution—using our understanding of the cosmos to illuminate human concerns. The Pale Blue Dot reflection is one of the most powerful perspective-shifting tools ever created. Widely applicable to ego problems, conflicts, anxiety, and decision-making.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9 - Clear process (zoom out, reframe, connect to meaning)
- Invocable: 10 - Very natural trigger phrases
- Scoped: 8 - Single responsibility (perspective-taking)
- Reusable: 10 - Applies to virtually any human concern
- Valuable: 10 - Profound impact on how people see their problems

**Score: 47/50 - HIGH**

### 3. wonder-communication

**Source Pattern:** Communication Style, Poetic Precision, The Star-Stuff Connection
**Purpose:** Transform technical or complex information into accessible, wonder-filled communication that inspires rather than merely informs.
**Trigger:** "Explain this like Sagan would" or "Make this inspiring" or "Communicate this with wonder"
**Inputs:** Technical or complex content to communicate, target audience, purpose (educate, inspire, persuade)
**Outputs:** Transformed content with: cosmic zoom/scale shifts, concrete imagery, measured rhythm, accessible language, connection to human meaning
**Reasoning:** Sagan revolutionized science communication—his techniques are teachable and transferable. Essential skill for scientists, educators, writers. Clear steps: simplify without dumbing down, use imagery, connect to wonder, end with meaning.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 8 - Multiple techniques with examples (cosmic zoom, star-stuff connection, poetic precision)
- Invocable: 9 - Natural trigger phrases
- Scoped: 8 - Single responsibility (transforming communication)
- Reusable: 10 - Any technical topic can benefit
- Valuable: 9 - Transforms effectiveness of science communication

**Score: 44/50 - HIGH**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. science-advocacy

**Source Pattern:** Science as Candle in the Dark, Famous Quotes on Scientific Literacy
**Purpose:** Articulate compelling arguments for why science matters—for education, funding, policy, and cultural respect for rational inquiry.
**Trigger:** "Why does science matter?" or "Make the case for science" or "Defend scientific thinking"
**Inputs:** Context (education debate, policy discussion, general audience), specific aspect to advocate for (research funding, science education, rational policy)
**Outputs:** Compelling argument connecting science to human flourishing, specific examples, anticipation and refutation of objections
**Reasoning:** Sagan dedicated much of his career to this. Framework is clear: connect science to survival, to wonder, to democracy. However, less structured than Baloney Detection Kit—more art than methodology.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 7 - Clear themes and arguments, less structured process
- Invocable: 8 - Natural trigger phrases
- Scoped: 8 - Single responsibility (science advocacy)
- Reusable: 8 - Many contexts where science needs defending
- Valuable: 8 - Important but more niche than universal critical thinking

**Score: 39/50 - MEDIUM**

### 5. existential-risk-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Nuclear Winter research, Pale Blue Dot future vision, "Prescription for disaster" quote
**Purpose:** Evaluate threats to human civilization or survival with appropriate gravity and analytical rigor, avoiding both dismissal and panic.
**Trigger:** "Assess this existential risk" or "How serious is this threat?" or "What are the long-term implications?"
**Inputs:** Potential threat (technological, environmental, social), scale of impact, current evidence
**Outputs:** Assessment of severity, comparison to other risks, probability estimation, mitigation options, call to appropriate action
**Reasoning:** Sagan pioneered this with nuclear winter—rigorous analysis of species-level threats. Increasingly relevant in age of climate change, AI, pandemics. However, methodology less formalized than Baloney Detection Kit.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 7 - Framework exists but less structured
- Invocable: 8 - Clear trigger phrases
- Scoped: 8 - Single responsibility (risk assessment at civilizational scale)
- Reusable: 7 - Important but more specialized application
- Valuable: 9 - High stakes decisions

**Score: 39/50 - MEDIUM**

### 6. star-stuff-connection

**Source Pattern:** "We are made of star-stuff" concept
**Purpose:** Help someone feel connected to the cosmos by explaining how the atoms in their body were forged in stellar cores billions of years ago.
**Trigger:** "Connect me to the cosmos" or "I feel insignificant" or "Help me see my place in the universe"
**Inputs:** Person's emotional state, specific feeling of disconnection or insignificance
**Outputs:** Explanation of cosmic connection, specific examples (iron in blood, calcium in bones), reframe from insignificance to profound connection
**Reasoning:** Powerful emotional and intellectual tool. However, more of a single insight than a full methodology—less structured than other skills.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 6 - Single concept with variations rather than multi-step process
- Invocable: 8 - Natural trigger phrases
- Scoped: 9 - Very focused single concept
- Reusable: 7 - Applies to feelings of disconnection/insignificance
