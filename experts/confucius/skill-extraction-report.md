## HIGH Priority

### 1. rectification-of-names-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Rectification of Names (Zhengming)
**Purpose:** Diagnose disorder by identifying where names (roles, labels, words) do not match reality, and prescribe alignment.
**Trigger:** "Why is this situation so confusing?" or "Help me clarify what's really going on" or "Are things what they claim to be?"
**Inputs:** Description of situation, roles/labels in question, observed behaviors
**Outputs:** Analysis of name-reality gaps, identification of false naming, prescription for rectification, predicted outcomes of correction
**Reasoning:** This is Confucius's most distinctive analytical contribution. The framework is clear: compare what things are called to what they actually are. Widely applicable to organizational dysfunction, role confusion, leadership assessment, and linguistic clarity. Provides unique insight not available from other frameworks.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear process: identify names, compare to reality, diagnose gaps, prescribe correction |
| Invocable | 8 | Natural triggers around confusion, role clarity, authenticity |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: name-reality alignment analysis |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to organizations, relationships, politics, self-assessment |
| Valuable | 9 | Reveals hidden sources of dysfunction; unique perspective |

**Total Score: 45 (HIGH)**

### 2. five-relationships-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Five Relationships (Wulun)
**Purpose:** Analyze any interpersonal or organizational situation through the lens of roles and reciprocal duties.
**Trigger:** "What do I owe in this relationship?" or "Analyze the relationship dynamics" or "What are our respective duties?"
**Inputs:** Description of relationship(s), parties involved, current conflict or question
**Outputs:** Role identification, duty mapping for each party, assessment of where duties are being fulfilled or neglected, guidance for restoration of proper relationship
**Reasoning:** Confucius's entire ethical framework rests on relationships with reciprocal duties. This provides a complete methodology for analyzing any human relationship, particularly useful for mentor-mentee, manager-subordinate, family, and peer relationships. The structured approach (identify roles, map duties, assess fulfillment) is immediately actionable.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear steps: identify relationship type, map duties, assess fulfillment |
| Invocable | 9 | Very natural triggers around relationships, duties, what's owed |
| Scoped | 9 | Single focus: relational role and duty analysis |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to all human relationships professional and personal |
| Valuable | 9 | Clarifies murky interpersonal dynamics; provides ethical grounding |

**Total Score: 46 (HIGH)**

### 3. self-examination-practice

**Source Pattern:** Self-Examination Method / Daily Three Points
**Purpose:** Structured self-reflection practice to identify personal shortcomings and areas for improvement before seeking to change others.
**Trigger:** "Help me examine myself" or "Before I blame others, what about me?" or "Daily reflection practice"
**Inputs:** Situation causing frustration, relationships involved, one's own actions and intentions
**Outputs:** Structured self-examination across key dimensions (loyalty, trustworthiness, practice of teachings), identification of personal failings, prescription for self-improvement before addressing others
**Reasoning:** Central to Confucian practice—the Master himself examined himself daily. Provides a concrete methodology for turning attention inward. Particularly valuable when someone is focused on others' faults. The "three points" framework is explicit and actionable.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Explicit three-point examination framework |
| Invocable | 8 | Triggered by frustration with others, desire for reflection |
| Scoped | 9 | Single purpose: personal fault-finding and correction |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to any situation of interpersonal friction |
| Valuable | 8 | Prevents unproductive blame; focuses on controllable change |

**Total Score: 44 (HIGH)**

### 4. virtue-cultivation-path

**Source Pattern:** Lifelong Path of Self-Cultivation (II-4) / Learning Method
**Purpose:** Guide long-term personal development through structured stages of moral and intellectual growth.
**Trigger:** "How do I become a better person?" or "What's my development path?" or "How do I cultivate virtue?"
**Inputs:** Current age/stage of life, areas of moral concern, learning goals
**Outputs:** Stage assessment (where are you on the path), guidance appropriate to stage, practices for advancement, long-term vision of development
**Reasoning:** Confucius provided explicit stage-wise development (15: set heart on learning; 30: established; 40: no perplexities; 50: know Heaven's mandate; 60: ear attuned; 70: desires aligned with rightness). This maps to coaching and development practice. Combined with the learning methods ("choose what is good and follow it"), provides complete development framework.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Stage framework with practices for each stage |
| Invocable | 9 | Very natural triggers around self-improvement, becoming better |
| Scoped | 8 | Covers development broadly, but single purpose |
| Reusable | 9 | Universal human aspiration for growth |
| Valuable | 8 | Provides life framework; reduces anxiety about development |

**Total Score: 42 (HIGH)**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. governance-through-virtue-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Rule by Moral Example / Against Coercive Rule
**Purpose:** Evaluate leadership approach and organizational culture through the lens of moral example vs. coercion.
**Trigger:** "How should I lead?" or "Is our leadership approach right?" or "Culture vs. compliance"
**Inputs:** Description of leadership practices, organizational norms, enforcement mechanisms
**Outputs:** Assessment of moral example vs. coercion balance, diagnosis of culture health, recommendations for virtue-based leadership
**Reasoning:** Confucius's governance philosophy centers on leading by example rather than force. Applicable to organizational leadership, parenting, and any situation of authority. The framework (moral example creates genuine compliance; punishment creates only avoidance) is clear and practical.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Principle is clear but execution guidance less specific |
| Invocable | 8 | Natural leadership development triggers |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused on leadership approach assessment |
| Reusable | 8 | Applies to management, parenting, teaching, governance |

**Purpose:** Restore harmony in relationships or groups through proper ritual, form, and sincere intention.
**Trigger:** "How do we restore harmony here?" or "There's conflict—how do we resolve it?" or "Bring people together"
**Inputs:** Description of disharmony, parties involved, history of conflict
**Outputs:** Diagnosis of where harmony broke down (lack of li or ren), specific practices for restoration, role assignments for each party
**Reasoning:** Harmony (he) is the goal of Confucian social ethics, achieved through the combination of proper form (li) and sincere benevolence (ren). The framework for understanding and restoring harmony is valuable for mediation, team dynamics, and family relationships.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Principle clear, but process less structured than other skills |
| Invocable | 8 | Very natural conflict resolution triggers |
| Scoped | 7 | Overlaps with relationship assessment somewhat |
| Reusable | 8 | Applies to family, workplace, community |
| Valuable | 7 | Provides framework but less unique than rectification of names |

**Total Score: 37 (MEDIUM)**
