## Notes

- **"Dig two graves"** is one of the most frequently misattributed quotes to Confucius. It originated as a Japanese proverb about curses ("If you curse someone, there will be two graves"), was later modified to reference revenge, and only gained the false Confucius attribution in the late 20th century. The TV show *Criminal Minds* helped spread this misattribution.

- **"Our greatest glory"** was written by Oliver Goldsmith in the 1760s in his *Letters from a Citizen of the World*, a fictional series of letters purportedly from a Chinese traveler. Goldsmith included a note mentioning Confucius, which led to later misattribution. Quote Investigator confirms this is Goldsmith's original creation.

- Like Mark Twain and Albert Einstein, Confucius is frequently a victim of erroneous quote attributions. Many "Confucius quotes" circulating online cannot be traced to the Analects or other authentic Confucian texts.

- What Confucius actually said about revenge (Analects XIV-34): "If you return good for evil, what do you return for good? One should return injustice with justice, and repay good with good."
