## Core Concepts (Quick Reference)

| Concept | Chinese | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Ren | 仁 | Benevolence, humaneness - the supreme virtue |
| Li | 禮 | Ritual propriety - the framework for ethical action |
| Junzi | 君子 | The exemplary person - the human ideal |
| Xiao | 孝 | Filial piety - reverence for parents and ancestors |
| Yi | 義 | Righteousness - doing what is appropriate |
| Zhi | 智 | Wisdom - understanding the nature of things |
| Xin | 信 | Trustworthiness - alignment between speech and action |

**Key relationships between concepts:**
- Ren is the inner substance; Li is the outer form through which it is expressed
- "To master oneself and return to li is ren." (XII-1)
- The junzi contrasts with xiaoren (small person) who seeks only profit

## On Governance

### Rule by Moral Example
"He who exercises government by means of his virtue may be compared to the north polar star, which keeps its place while all the stars turn towards it." (II-1)

### Against Coercive Rule
"Lead the people with governmental measures and regulate them by law and punishment, and they will avoid wrongdoing but have no sense of honor and shame. Lead them with virtue and regulate them by the rules of propriety, and they will have a sense of shame and, moreover, set themselves right." (II-3)

### The Ruler's Character
"If a ruler sets himself right, he will be followed without his command. If he does not set himself right, his commands will not be obeyed." (XIII-6)

### Practical Governance
When asked what was needed first for government, Confucius replied: "Sufficient food, sufficient arms, and the trust of the people." When pressed to choose one to eliminate, he said arms, then food. "For from of old, death has been the lot of all men; but a people that no longer trusts its rulers is lost indeed." (XII-7)

## Famous Maxims

### On Virtue and Character
- "The superior man thinks always of virtue; the common man thinks of comfort."
- "To practice five things under all circumstances constitutes perfect virtue: gravity, generosity of soul, sincerity, earnestness, and kindness."
- "He who conquers himself is the mightiest warrior."
- "Virtue is not left to stand alone. He who practices it will have neighbors."

### On Learning
- "Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance."
- "By three methods we may learn wisdom: first, by reflection, which is noblest; second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest."
- "To be fond of learning is to be near to knowledge."
- "Learning without thought is labor lost; thought without learning is perilous." (II-15)
- "Is it not a pleasure to learn and to practice what you have learned?" (I-1)

### On Relationships
- "What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others." (XV-24)
- "The strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home."

### On Self-Improvement
- "It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop."
- "When you see a worthy person, endeavor to emulate them. When you see an unworthy person, examine yourself." (IV-17)

## The Dao of Confucius

Confucius's dao (way) is not metaphysical abstraction but practical ethics:
- The way of the sage-kings of antiquity
- The way of becoming fully human through virtue
- The way of harmony in society through proper relationships
- The way of self-cultivation through learning and practice

## Misunderstandings to Correct

### "Confucianism is rigid hierarchy"
The relationships are reciprocal—superiors have duties to inferiors. A ruler who doesn't rule benevolently forfeits the claim to obedience.

### "Li is empty formalism"
Confucius explicitly warns against form without substance: "What can I see in the rituals of a man who is not ren?" (III-3)

### "Confucianism suppresses individuality"
Self-cultivation is central—the aim is developing one's full human potential, not conformity for its own sake.

### "Confucius was otherworldly"
He explicitly focused on human affairs: "Not yet knowing life, how can one know death?" (XI-12)
