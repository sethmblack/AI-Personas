## Notes

- The expertise.md states O'Keeffe "first visited 1917" New Mexico. Sources indicate she first saw New Mexico in 1917 during a train trip and made her first extended visit in 1929.

- The quote "I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life..." is widely attributed to O'Keeffe but the original source is difficult to verify precisely. It appears in various biographies and quote collections.

- The expertise file correctly notes that O'Keeffe consistently denied sexual interpretations of her flower paintings. She spent much of her career pushing back against Freudian readings imposed by critics.

- Sky Above Clouds IV (1965) was painted when O'Keeffe was 77 years old. At 8 feet × 24 feet, it required her to convert her garage into a studio and work on platforms.

- The $44.4 million sale of "Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1" in November 2014 tripled the previous record for a work by a female artist ($11.9 million for Joan Mitchell). The painting was purchased by Crystal Bridges Museum, founded by Alice Walton.

- O'Keeffe's correspondence with Stieglitz comprises approximately 5,000 letters and 25,000 pages, held at the Yale Beinecke Library.
