## Key Works and Periods

### Charcoal Abstractions (1915-1916)
Early experimental works created in Texas and South Carolina. O'Keeffe began developing her personal style through simplified, expressive charcoal drawings of natural forms—ferns, clouds, waves—reduced to essential shapes and lines.

**Significance:** These works caught Alfred Stieglitz's attention and launched her career.

### Flower Paintings (1924-1930s)
Large-scale, magnified depictions of flowers that became her signature. Began with petunias, progressed to Oriental poppies, jimson weed, calla lilies, and irises.

**Key works:**
- *Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1* (1932) - Sold for $44.4 million in 2014
- *Oriental Poppies* (1927)
- *Black Iris* (1926)
- *The White Calico Flower* (1931)

### New York Cityscapes (1925-1930)
Urban paintings depicting Manhattan skyscrapers, rooftops, and the city from her apartment in the Shelton Hotel. Demonstrated her range beyond natural subjects.

**Key works:**
- *City Night* (1926)
- *Radiator Building—Night, New York* (1927)

### New Mexico Landscapes (1929-1986)
Desert landscapes, adobe architecture, mesas, and the distinctive geography of Ghost Ranch and Abiquiu. Colors shifted, compositions opened, space became as important as object.

**Key works:**
- *Black Mesa Landscape, New Mexico / Out Back of Marie's II* (1930)
- *Red Hills and Bones* (1941)
- *Pedernal* (multiple versions)
- *Above the Clouds* series (1960s)

### Bones and Skulls (1930s-1940s)
Bleached animal bones collected from the desert floor, painted against sky and landscape. For O'Keeffe, bones were not macabre but "very lively."

**Key works:**
- *Cow's Skull: Red, White, and Blue* (1931)
- *Ram's Head, White Hollyhock—Hills* (1935)
- *Summer Days* (1936)
- *Pelvis Series* (1940s)

### Patio Door Series (1946-1960)
Over 20 paintings of the patio door at her Abiquiu home, demonstrating her commitment to working an idea repeatedly until satisfied.

### Sky Above Clouds (1960s)
Late aerial paintings inspired by views from airplane windows, depicting cloudscapes stretching to the horizon.

**Key work:** *Sky Above Clouds IV* (1965) - 24 feet wide, her largest painting.

## Historical Context

### Artistic Influences

**Arthur Wesley Dow:**
Teacher whose philosophy profoundly shaped O'Keeffe. Dow advocated simplifying forms to capture essence, developing personal style through self-exploration, and creating art based on interpretation rather than copying.

**Paul Strand:**
Photographer whose cropping techniques O'Keeffe adapted to painting. She was one of the first artists to apply photographic close-up methods to paint.

**Alfred Stieglitz:**
Photographer, gallerist, and eventually O'Keeffe's husband. Through his 291 Gallery, he introduced O'Keeffe to European modernism and American avant-garde artists.

### Key Relationships

**Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946):**
Met in 1916 when he exhibited her charcoal drawings without permission. They began a relationship in 1918 and married in 1924. Stieglitz promoted her work and photographed her extensively. Their marriage was complex—he had affairs; she increasingly sought solitude in New Mexico. She managed his estate after his death in 1946.

**Juan Hamilton:**
Young artist who became O'Keeffe's assistant, companion, and eventual heir in her final years (1973-1986). Helped her continue working despite failing eyesight.

### Geographic Locations

**New York (1918-1949):**
Center of her commercial art career. Lake George summer home where she painted during the 1920s.

**New Mexico (1929-1986):**
- First visited 1917; serious engagement began 1929
- **Ghost Ranch** (1934-1986): Purchased a house on the property in 1940. Dramatic multicolored cliffs inspired her most famous landscapes.
- **Abiquiu** (1945-1986): Purchased a ruined adobe house with a walled garden. The patio door became a recurring subject.

## Famous Quotes

### On Seeing
- "Nobody sees a flower—really—it is so small—we haven't time—and to see takes time like to have a friend takes time."
- "I hate flowers—I paint them because they're cheaper than models and they don't move."
- "When you take a flower in your hand and really look at it, it's your world for the moment."

### On Expression
- "I found I could say things with color and shapes that I couldn't say any other way—things I had no words for."
- "The meaning of a word—to me—is not as exact as the meaning of a color. Colors and shapes make a more definite statement than words."
- "It is not the object that I paint but the emotion it produces on me."

### On Independence
- "I've been absolutely terrified every moment of my life and I've never let it keep me from a single thing that I wanted to do."
- "When people read erotic symbols into my paintings, they are really talking about their own affairs."
- "I said to myself, 'I have things in my head that are not like what anyone has taught me—shapes and ideas so natural to my way of being and thinking that it hasn't occurred to me to put them down.' I decided to start anew to strip away what I had been taught."

### On Nature and Place
- "If you ever go to New Mexico, it will itch you for the rest of your life. You will be thinking about going back there."
- "Such a beautiful, untouched lonely feeling place, such a fine part of what I call the 'Faraway.'"
- "It never occurs to me that [skulls] have anything to do with death. They are very lively."

### On Work and Process
- "I have a single-track mind. I work on an idea for a long time."
- "The painting of this morning is no good. But I was much excited over it—and know that something will come."
- "My pleasant disposition likes the world with nobody in it."

### On Artistic Philosophy
- "The abstraction is often the most definite form for the intangible thing in myself that I can only clarify in paint."
- "Great artists don't just happen, any more than writers, or singers, or other creators. They have to be trained, and in the hard school of experience."

## Misunderstandings to Correct

### "Her flowers are sexual symbols"
Art critics consistently insisted O'Keeffe's flower paintings were commentary on female sexuality. She resolutely denied these interpretations. For her, they were about SEEING—a magnifying lens for attention.

### "Abstraction vs. Realism"
O'Keeffe rejected being categorized as either an abstract or realist painter. She used abstract principles to reveal deeper reality. Her work was always rooted in specific observations of nature, even when highly distilled.

### "She was Stieglitz's protégé"
While Stieglitz promoted her work and they married, O'Keeffe maintained fierce independence. She spent increasing time away from New York and his circle, eventually choosing to live full-time in New Mexico.

### "The bones represent death"
O'Keeffe saw desert bones as full of life, not morbid. "They are very lively. I have enjoyed them very much in relation to the sky."
