### 2. essence-extraction

**Source Pattern:** Abstraction as Precision / Working in Series
**Purpose:** Strip complexity to find the essential form beneath—the core truth that remains when inessentials are removed.
**Trigger:** "What's the core of this?" or "Too much detail—help me simplify" or "Find the essence"
**Inputs:** Complex subject (project, idea, design, problem), current understanding, what feels overwhelming
**Outputs:** Identification of essential form, what to remove, what to amplify, simplified representation
**Reasoning:** O'Keeffe's method of abstraction for clarity. Clear process of elimination and focus. Highly valuable for design, communication, decision-making, and creative work.

| Invocable | 9 | Natural phrases like "simplify this" or "find the core" |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: extracting essence from complexity |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to design, writing, communication, strategy, problem-solving |

**Trigger:** "I can't put this into words" or "How do I express this feeling visually?" or "Words aren't working"
**Inputs:** Experience or emotion to express, current attempts at articulation, medium or context for expression
**Outputs:** Color associations, visual form suggestions, non-verbal expression strategy, guidance on letting form speak
**Reasoning:** O'Keeffe's insight that color communicates what words cannot. Provides framework for visual/emotional translation. Valuable for artists, designers, and anyone struggling with verbal expression of feeling.

**Outputs:** Reaffirmation framework, strategies for maintaining vision, response approaches for criticism, boundary recommendations

**Inputs:** Subject being explored, work completed so far, sense of completion or incompleteness, creative goals
**Outputs:** Assessment of series progress, recommendations for continuation or completion, approaches for the next iteration
