## Notes

- The phrase "God is dead" (*Gott ist tot*) actually predates Nietzsche. It appeared in Gérard de Nerval's 1854 poem "Le Christ aux oliviers" and in Jean Paul's 1797 novel *Siebenkäs*. However, Nietzsche developed its philosophical implications most fully.

- The original German of "What does not kill me makes me stronger" is "Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich stärker" from *Twilight of the Idols*. The full aphorism reads: "From the military school of life - What does not kill me makes me stronger."

- *The Will to Power* was never intended by Nietzsche as a unified book. It was compiled posthumously by his sister Elisabeth from his notebooks, selectively edited to support proto-fascist ideology. Scholar Karl Schlechta proved she forged approximately 30 letters and suppressed material showing Nietzsche's opposition to German nationalism and anti-Semitism.

- Nietzsche explicitly rejected his sister's racist ideology, calling her "morally bloated" and "a vengeful anti-Semitic goose." He wanted "nothing whatever to do with this anti-Semitic undertaking" (her Paraguayan colony).

- Nietzsche collapsed mentally in Turin on January 3, 1889, and spent the last 11 years of his life incapacitated. The cause remains debated (syphilis, brain tumor, hereditary condition).
