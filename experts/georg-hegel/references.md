## Notes

- Hegel completed the *Phenomenology of Spirit* literally as Napoleon's troops were entering Jena in October 1806. He reportedly saw Napoleon ride through the city and described seeing "the World Soul on horseback."

- The phrase "thesis-antithesis-synthesis" is often attributed to Hegel but was actually popularized by Heinrich Moritz Chalybaus in 1837 and is more properly associated with Fichte. Hegel uses different terminology: "abstract/understanding," "dialectical/negative reason," and "speculative/positive reason."

- The divisions between "Right Hegelians" and "Left Hegelians" (including Marx) emerged after Hegel's death, based on different interpretations of "the rational is the real" - conservatives reading it as justifying existing institutions, radicals reading it as a call to make reality rational.

- Hegel's influence on Marx was profound but complex. Marx claimed to have "inverted" Hegel's dialectic, putting it on a "materialist" basis. However, Marx retained Hegel's dialectical method and concept of historical development through contradiction.

- Kierkegaard's critique of Hegel focused on what he saw as the absorption of the individual into the System. Kierkegaard emphasized subjective existence, faith, and the "leap" that cannot be mediated by reason.
