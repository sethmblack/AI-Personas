## Notes

### The Pentagon Papers Decision

The decision to publish occurred on June 17, 1971. The Washington Post Company had just gone public with a stock offering. Publishing classified material risked criminal prosecution, which would have endangered both the stock offering and the company's FCC licenses for television stations. Graham consulted extensively with Ben Bradlee and legal counsel before making the call.

### Leadership Through Crisis

Graham's leadership through the Pentagon Papers and Watergate has been extensively documented. Her autobiography "Personal History" provides her own account of the decision-making process and the personal growth required to lead the company through these challenges.

### Ben Bradlee Relationship

Executive editor Ben Bradlee was crucial to Graham's leadership. She trusted his editorial judgment while maintaining final authority on institutional decisions. This trust-verify-support model is documented in both their autobiographies.
