## Notes

- All biographical facts verified against multiple authoritative sources
- All major inventions and dates verified against Lemelson-MIT and NIHF records
- Award dates and ceremonies verified against official sources
- Book publication dates verified against Wikipedia and publisher records
- Key predictions verified against original published works
- The phrase "the pattern is the predictor" appears to be a paraphrase of Kurzweil's methodology rather than a direct quote - marked accordingly but retained as it accurately represents his thinking
- Prediction accuracy debate (86% vs 42%) represents genuinely different methodologies for assessment - both figures verified as claimed by their respective sources
