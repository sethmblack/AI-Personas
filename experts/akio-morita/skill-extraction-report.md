## HIGH Priority

### 1. market-creation-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The Market Creation Framework + Morita's Method for Product Development
**Purpose:** Guide product teams through creating products users don't yet know they want by observing behavior rather than surveying preferences
**Trigger:** "How do we know if users will want this?", "Should we do market research?", "Creating a new product category"
**Inputs:** Target user description, observed behaviors, proposed product concept, team intuitions
**Outputs:** Behavior-based opportunity assessment, intuition validation framework, commitment recommendations
**Reasoning:** Clear 5-phase methodology combining observation, intuition, and commitment. Highly applicable to product development in tech. Directly addresses common over-reliance on surveys. Estimated 2+ uses per week for product teams.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 2. global-first-design-review

**Source Pattern:** The Global-First Design Principle
**Purpose:** Review products, features, or APIs for global readiness from initial design phase
**Trigger:** "Is this ready for international?", "Review for global launch", "i18n assessment"
**Inputs:** Product/feature description, target markets, current design decisions
**Outputs:** Global readiness assessment, localization requirements, naming review, cultural neutrality analysis
**Reasoning:** 5-point framework from Morita's Sony globalization strategy. Applicable to software products, APIs, documentation. Prevents costly retrofitting. Medium frequency but high value when internationalization is relevant.
