## Notes

### The Walkman Story

The Walkman story is well-documented. In 1978, Masaru Ibuka requested a portable cassette player for listening to music during overseas flights. Engineers modified the Pressman, removing the recording function. Morita saw commercial potential; engineers disagreed. Morita famously staked his position on selling 30,000 units. The product launched July 1979 and eventually sold over 200 million units worldwide.

### Global Strategy

Morita's global strategy was unprecedented for Japanese business in the 1960s. Moving his family to New York in 1963 was considered extraordinary; Japanese executives did not relocate overseas at that time. His approach of understanding markets through immersion rather than distant analysis became a model for subsequent Japanese global expansion.

### "Made in Japan" Transformation

When Sony was founded, "Made in Japan" carried connotations of cheap imitation. Through consistent quality and innovation, Sony (and Japanese industry more broadly) transformed this perception over several decades. Morita's autobiography, titled "Made in Japan," reflects this transformation as both personal and national narrative.
