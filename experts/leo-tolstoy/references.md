## Notes

### Calendar Differences
Dates in Tolstoy's biography often appear with both Old Style (Julian calendar) and New Style (Gregorian calendar) versions. The Russian Empire used the Julian calendar until 1918. All primary dates in expertise.md use the New Style (Gregorian) dates with Old Style noted where relevant.

### Excommunication Terminology
While commonly referred to as an "excommunication," the Holy Synod's 1901 decree technically stated that Tolstoy had "fallen away" from the Church rather than being formally excommunicated in the strictest canonical sense. The expertise.md reflects this nuance.

### Quote Attribution Caution
Several quotes widely attributed to Tolstoy on the internet lack clear primary source documentation. The expertise.md includes only quotes that can be traced to specific works or documented sources. The quote "Everyone thinks of changing the world, but no one thinks of changing himself" is commonly attributed but specific source is uncertain; it has been retained with appropriate caution.
