## Key Works

### War and Peace (1869)
An epic novel spanning the years 1805-1820, following five aristocratic Russian families during the Napoleonic Wars. Often considered the greatest novel ever written.

**Writing process:**
- Written at Yasnaya Polyana between 1862 and 1869
- First draft completed in less than one year
- Tolstoy revised it at least seven times before final publication
- His wife Sophia copied the entire manuscript seven times by candlelight
- Portions serialized in *The Russian Messenger* from 1865-1867 as *The Year 1805*
- Includes approximately 160 historical figures among its characters
- Tolstoy cited Victor Hugo's *Les Misérables* (1862) as a major influence
- Literary critics have compared its structure to Laurence Sterne's *Tristram Shandy*

**Structure:**
- Four books consisting of fifteen parts and two epilogues
- Uses five interlocking narratives following different Russian aristocratic families
- Percy Lubbock described it as "like an Iliad, the story of certain men, and an Aeneid, the story of a nation, compressed into one book"
- The Russian word "mir" in the title has multiple meanings: peace (absence of war), world, and community

**Core themes:**
- The nature of history and historical causation
- Free will versus determinism
- The search for meaning in life
- Authentic living versus social pretense
- The relationship between the individual and historical forces
- Tolstoy's philosophy of history: events result from millions of individual chains of cause and effect, not great men

**Key characters:**
- Prince Andrei Bolkonsky: The disillusioned idealist seeking meaning
- Pierre Bezukhov: The seeker who finds truth through suffering
- Natasha Rostova: Life force, spontaneity, emotional truth
- General Kutuzov: Wisdom of patience and non-action

**Critical reception:**
- Ivan Turgenev called it "one of the most remarkable books of our age"
- Fyodor Dostoevsky described it as "the last word of the landlord's literature and the brilliant one at that"
- Virginia Woolf called it "the greatest of all novels"
- Thomas Mann compared it to Homer's *Iliad*

### Anna Karenina (1877)
The story of Anna's doomed love affair with Count Vronsky, counterpointed with Levin's search for meaning through work, family, and faith.

**Opening line:** "All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."

**Epigraph:** "Vengeance is mine; I will repay" - Romans 12:19 (quoting Deuteronomy 32:35)

**Epigraph interpretation:**
- Tolstoy stated in his diaries that the epigraph encapsulates a major theme: the importance of leaving judgment of others to God
- A warning to both Russian society and the reader that only God may judge
- The word "vengeance" is almost a red herring - the novel is really about humility before God's judgment, the opposite of revenge
- Possible targets: Anna herself, Vronsky, and Russian society's hypocrisy

**Core themes:**
- The nature of love and marriage
- Authentic versus inauthentic living
- Hypocrisy of Russian society (particularly gender double standards)
- The consequences of passion versus convention
- Rural versus urban life
- The search for faith
- Personal accountability

**Critical reception:**
- Dostoevsky declared it "flawless"
- Often called "the greatest novel ever written according to top authors and laymen alike"

### The Death of Ivan Ilyich (1886)
A novella following a successful judge who, facing death from illness, realizes his entire life has been false and meaningless. Written shortly after Tolstoy's religious conversion.

**Core themes:**
- The universal denial of death
- The falseness of conventional life ("artificial" vs. "authentic" life)
- Authentic versus inauthentic existence
- The possibility of redemption at the end of life
- The spiritual versus the physical self
- Preparation for death begins with a proper attitude toward life

**Two types of life (Tolstoy's framework):**
- **Artificial life:** Shallow relationships, self-interest, materialism, insular and unfulfilling
- **Authentic life:** Pity and compassion, seeing others as individuals, mutually affirming relationships

**Key insight:** Ivan's recognition that "maybe I did not live as I ought to have done"

**The ending:** Ivan's transformation - as he pities his son and wife, his terror of death leaves him, and death itself "turns into light"

**Vladimir Nabokov's interpretation:** "The Tolstoyan formula is: Ivan lived a bad life and since the bad life is nothing but the death of the soul, then Ivan lived a living death; and since beyond death is God's living light, then Ivan died into a new life."

### Resurrection (1899)
A novel about Prince Nekhlyudov who, serving on a jury, recognizes the prostitute defendant as a woman he seduced and ruined in his youth. His attempt at redemption through helping her.

**Core themes:**
- Moral awakening and responsibility
- Criticism of the judicial system
- The possibility of spiritual rebirth
- Tolstoy's mature religious and social views

### Hadji Murad (1912, posthumous)

- Used material from Russian archives, including Hadji Murad's own account of his life
- Tolstoy admitted he had to "write it on the sly from myself" since it betrayed his didactic aims for art

**Critical acclaim:**
- Harold Bloom called it "my personal touchstone for the sublime of prose fiction, to me the best story in the world"

### Confession (1882)

**Key elements:**
- Documents his existential crisis and contemplation of suicide
- The central question: "If God does not exist, since death is inevitable, what is the meaning of life?"
- Describes his search for meaning through philosophy, science, and finally faith
- Tolstoy stated: "I felt there was nothing beneath my feet anymore... And I no longer had any prop to help me live"

### The Kingdom of God Is Within You (1894)
Christian anarchist philosophical treatise, first published in Germany after being banned in Russia.

**Significance:**
- Culmination of 30 years of Tolstoy's thinking on nonviolence
- Lays out organization for society based on universal love
- Key text for Tolstoyan nonviolence and Christian anarchism
- Gandhi wrote it "overwhelmed" him and "left an abiding impression"

## Tolstoy and Gandhi: A Transformative Correspondence

### The Impact of *The Kingdom of God Is Within You*
- Gandhi wrote in autobiography *The Story of My Experiments with Truth* that the book "overwhelmed" him and "left an abiding impression"
- Listed it among three most important modern influences (with Ruskin's *Unto This Last* and poet Shrimad Rajchandra)
- Gandhi in 1928: "At that time, I was skeptical about many things... I was a votary of violence. I had faith in it and none in nonviolence. After I read this book, lack of faith in nonviolence vanished"

### The Correspondence (1909-1910)
- Began with Tolstoy's "A Letter to a Hindu" (December 14, 1908) to Tarak Nath Das
- Letter argued only through love could India gain independence from colonial rule
- Gandhi wrote to request permission to reprint in his South African newspaper *Indian Opinion* (1909)
- Gandhi translated the letter into Gujarati
- Exchange evolved into year-long correspondence until Tolstoy's death

### Tolstoy Farm
- 1910: Gandhi and Hermann Kallenbach established commune in South Africa named "Tolstoy Farm"
- Families lived simply, worked collectively, practiced nonviolence, truth, and self-reliance
- Became training ground for Gandhi's movement

### Legacy Chain
- Tolstoy influenced Gandhi's concept of satyagraha (truth-force)
- Gandhi influenced Martin Luther King Jr., who traveled to India in 1959
- King called Gandhi "the guiding light of our technique of nonviolent social change"
- The genealogy: Tolstoy -> Gandhi -> King

## Philosophical Foundations

### The Moral Question
For Tolstoy, all questions ultimately reduce to: How should we live? Philosophy, art, religion - all must answer this or they are worthless.

### Authenticity vs. Convention
Most people live by convention - doing what is expected, pursuing what society values - rather than asking what is truly good. This false life leads to spiritual death while still physically alive. Ivan Ilyich is the paradigmatic example.

### The Wisdom of the Simple
Peasants and simple people often possess intuitive wisdom that educated people have lost. Sophistication can be a form of elaborate self-deception. Gerasim in *The Death of Ivan Ilyich* represents authentic life.

### Christian Anarchism
- Rejection of state authority and violence
- Literal interpretation of Jesus's teachings
- "Do not resist evil by force" (Sermon on the Mount)
- The state, the church, the military, the courts - all institutions of violence
- Influenced Gandhi's satyagraha and Martin Luther King Jr.'s nonviolent resistance

### The Doctrine of Non-Resistance
Evil cannot be overcome by evil. Violence perpetuates itself. Only by refusing to participate in violence - even defensive violence - can the cycle be broken.

### Philosophy of History (*War and Peace*)
- History is not created by great men
- Events result from millions of individual chains of cause and effect too small to be analyzed
- Even emperors are caught in chains of circumstance, though they imagine they rule the world
- Critiques theories that give power to individual "great men"

### On Death
- Most people live in denial of death
- Only by facing mortality can we understand life
- Death strips away pretense and reveals what matters
- Preparation for death begins with proper attitude toward life

---

## Literary Techniques

### Defamiliarization (Ostranenie)
Viktor Shklovsky, Russian Formalist critic, coined this term in 1917 using Tolstoy as the primary example.

**Definition:** The artistic technique of forcing the audience to see common things in an unfamiliar or strange way, to enhance perception of the familiar.

**Tolstoy's use:**
- In *War and Peace*, Natasha at the opera sees "painted cardboard and oddly dressed men and women who moved, spoke and sang strangely in a patch of blazing light"
- In "Kholstomer," the narrator is a horse, making property and ownership seem absurd
- Shklovsky noted Tolstoy's "several hundred examples... [applied] the device of estrangement to his [descriptions] of the dogmas and rituals" of Orthodox Church and Russian life

**Purpose:** Tolstoy used defamiliarization for social criticism - forcing readers to reassess "the habitualized normalities of the Russian elite"

**Influence:** Connected to Brecht's Verfremdungseffekt ("estrangement effect"); became central concept of twentieth-century art

### The Panoramic to Particular Method
Tolstoy moves seamlessly between the vast (historical forces, battlefields, social movements) and the intimate (a character's thought, a physical gesture).

### Free Indirect Discourse
Entering a character's consciousness while maintaining narrative distance, allowing the reader to see both the character's perspective and its limitations.

### Physical Observation as Psychology
Inner states revealed through precise observation of bodies: gestures, postures, facial expressions, ways of walking and sitting.

### Multiple Perspectives
The same event shown from different viewpoints, each partial and limited, together approaching a larger truth.
