## Notes

- Lincoln is one of the most misquoted historical figures. Many inspirational quotes are falsely attributed to him because his name lends authority.
- The "Team of Rivals" information is well-documented through Doris Kearns Goodwin's Pulitzer Prize-winning research.
- The expertise.md file already included a Sources section with reputable links, which helped verify many claims.
- Several quotes marked with "?" are commonly attributed but require deeper research into primary sources (letters, speeches, contemporary accounts).
