# Abraham Lincoln: Expertise Reference

## Overview

Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) served as the 16th President of the United States during its most perilous period. A self-educated lawyer from Illinois, he preserved the Union through the Civil War, ended slavery, and demonstrated that democratic government could endure existential crisis. His rhetorical mastery and moral leadership make him one of history's most studied leaders.

## Background

### Core Leadership Attributes

Lincoln's leadership was defined by six core qualities (per Doris Kearns Goodwin):
1. **Clear sense of purpose** - Unwavering commitment to preserving the Union and, ultimately, ending slavery
2. **Realistic assessment** - Understanding what was possible in the moment vs. what required patience
3. **Humility** - Acknowledging his own limitations and uncertainties
4. **Self-assurance** - Confidence in his judgment despite lack of credentials
5. **Detached analytical thinking** - Ability to see situations from multiple perspectives
6. **Belief in human goodness** - Faith in "the better angels of our nature"

### Participative Leadership Style

Lincoln pioneered what would later be called "participative leadership":
- Invited cabinet members to share in decision-making
- Created an environment where disagreement was safe
- Never retaliated against those who challenged his views
- Valued diverse perspectives over ideological conformity

### Managing by Wandering Around (MBWA)

Lincoln was an early practitioner of what became known as MBWA:
- Spent 75% of his time meeting with people informally
- Virtually lived at the War Department telegraph office to access real-time information
- Made himself exceptionally accessible to citizens and soldiers
- Gathered intelligence directly rather than relying solely on reports

## Historical Context

### The Team of Rivals Cabinet

Lincoln deliberately appointed his political rivals to his cabinet:
- **William H. Seward** (Secretary of State) - Chief rival for Republican nomination
- **Salmon P. Chase** (Secretary of Treasury) - Ambitious critic who sought Lincoln's job
- **Edward Bates** (Attorney General) - Conservative rival
- **Edwin Stanton** (Secretary of War) - Had insulted Lincoln professionally

This approach demonstrated that Lincoln valued competence and diverse perspectives over personal comfort or ideological conformity.

### Literary Influences

Lincoln's style synthesized:
- **The Bible** - Daily reading, especially King James Version
- **Shakespeare** - Deep familiarity with the plays
- **Robert Burns** - Scottish poet's cadences
- **Euclid** - Geometric proof structure influenced speech organization
- **Legal training** - Clarity and brevity from courtroom practice

### The Paradox of Humor and Melancholy

Despite his humor, observers noted Lincoln had "the saddest face" they had ever seen. His wit emerged from depth, not superficiality. Stephen Douglas, Lincoln's longtime rival, conceded: "When he begins to tell a story, I'm overmatched."
