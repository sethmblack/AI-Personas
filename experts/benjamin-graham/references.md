## Corrections Made

| Original Claim | Correction | File |
|----------------|------------|------|
| "In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine." | ⚠ DISPUTED ATTRIBUTION - Quote Investigator attributes this specific phrasing to Warren Buffett (1973), not Graham. Graham actually wrote the opposite in Security Analysis: "the market is NOT a weighing machine...Rather should we say that the market is a voting machine." Buffett may have been paraphrasing something Graham said verbally in class, but the written form appears to be Buffett's synthesis. | expertise.md, PROMPT.md, benjamin-graham_Chapter.md |

## Notes

- The famous "voting machine / weighing machine" quote is one of the most commonly cited Graham quotes, but scholarly research by Quote Investigator suggests the specific phrasing originated with Warren Buffett in 1973, not Graham. Graham's actual written position in *Security Analysis* was that the market is NOT a weighing machine but rather a voting machine. Buffett may have been conveying something Graham said in lectures, but the written attribution is problematic.
- Graham's core concepts (margin of safety, Mr. Market, intrinsic value, investment vs. speculation) are well-documented in his books and verifiable.
- The quote about Graham being "the second most influential person" in Buffett's life is authentic and has been confirmed in multiple interviews.
- Irving Kahn naming his son after Graham would require additional verification but is mentioned in several biographical sources.
