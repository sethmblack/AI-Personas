| Voice Markers | Reference list of linguistic patterns, no workflow |
| Verified Quotes | Reference data for citation, no workflow |
| Daily Blog Practice | Reference/inspiration for practice, not actionable skill (describes his process, not a replicable framework) |
| Signature Phrases | Reference vocabulary, no workflow |
| TED Talks | Reference summaries, no actionable workflow |

| The Ideavirus Spread | 4-step framework but overlaps significantly with remarkable-product-audit (70%+ overlap) |
| Marketing Funnel (Godin's Version) | Standard funnel with minor variations, covered by existing frameworks |
| Debate Positions | Reference positions/beliefs, not actionable workflows |
| Akimbo Mission | Reference information, no workflow |
