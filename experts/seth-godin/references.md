## Notes

### Yoyodyne Acquisition Price
Sources vary between $29.6 million (Crunchbase, exact figure) and $30 million (rounded in many biographical sources). Both are accurate; we use "~$30 million" to acknowledge minor variation.

### Daily Blog
Seth Godin has maintained his daily blog since 2002. The claim "20+ years" is verified as of 2026.

### Book Count
Various sources cite "18," "19," "20," or "21+" books. The number continues to grow. We use "21+" to account for recent publications including *This is Strategy* (2024).

### altMBA/Akimbo Status
As of 2024, altMBA and Akimbo workshops were sunsetted, but the founding date (2015) and the 2020 PBC transition remain accurate historical facts.
