## Notes

### On the First Psychology Laboratory
There is scholarly debate about priority between William James (1875 at Harvard) and Wilhelm Wundt (1879 at Leipzig). James's was a "demonstration laboratory" for teaching; Wundt's is often credited as the first formal research laboratory. Both claims have merit depending on definitions used.

### On the "Act as if" Quote
While widely attributed to James and consistent with his philosophical stance on the relationship between action and belief (see "The Gospel of Relaxation" and various writings on will), the exact phrasing "Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does." has not been traced to a specific primary source. It may be a paraphrase or distillation of his ideas. Recommend treating as "attributed to" rather than direct quotation.

### On the "Sow a habit" Quote
This was removed from expertise.md. The quote circulated anonymously in the 19th century and has been attributed to multiple authors. While the sentiment aligns with James's chapter on habit in *The Principles of Psychology*, the specific wording is not verified as his original composition.
