## HIGH Priority

### 1. cash-value-test

**Source Pattern:** The Pragmatic Method / Cash-Value Testing
**Purpose:** Evaluate any idea, concept, or theory by translating it into experiential consequences and stripping away merely verbal disputes
**Trigger:** "What's the practical difference?", "Does this matter in practice?", "Is this a real dispute or just words?", "Apply the cash-value test"
**Inputs:** An idea, concept, theory, or dispute to evaluate; optionally, the context of application
**Outputs:** Analysis showing: (1) the practical consequences if the idea is true, (2) whether the dispute is verbal or substantive, (3) recommendation based on experiential consequences
**Reasoning:** This is James's signature contribution to philosophy. Clear 4-step process (state dispute, trace cash-value, test experientially, dissolve or decide). Highly reusable across any domain where theoretical debates need grounding. Saves significant time by cutting through empty arguments. Estimated 5+ uses per week in technical discussions.

### 2. will-to-believe-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Will to Believe Framework (Living/Forced/Momentous Options)
**Purpose:** Determine whether a decision qualifies as a "genuine option" where faith-based commitment is legitimate despite incomplete evidence
**Trigger:** "Should I commit without full evidence?", "Is this a leap of faith?", "Can I justify this bet?", "Assess this decision using will-to-believe"
**Inputs:** A proposed decision or commitment; the available evidence; the stakes involved; time constraints
**Outputs:** Analysis showing: (1) whether the option is living (genuinely possible), (2) whether forced (waiting is itself a choice), (3) whether momentous (high stakes, non-reversible), (4) recommendation on whether passional commitment is justified
**Reasoning:** James's framework for when faith-based decisions are epistemically legitimate. Clear 3-criterion assessment (living, forced, momentous). Highly applicable to technology adoption, MVP launches, career decisions. Saves 30+ minutes of agonizing over incomplete evidence. Estimated 3+ uses per week.

### 3. habit-formation-protocol

**Source Pattern:** Habit: Make Your Nervous System Your Ally
**Purpose:** Design and implement a habit formation plan using James's principles for making automatic behaviors work in your favor
**Trigger:** "How do I build this habit?", "Help me form a new practice", "I want to change my behavior", "Apply habit formation principles"
**Inputs:** The desired habit or behavior change; current obstacles; available resources for initial commitment
**Outputs:** A habit formation plan including: (1) strong initiative launch strategy, (2) exception-prevention rules, (3) opportunity capture mechanisms, (4) effort maintenance practices
**Reasoning:** James's chapter on habit is foundational in psychology. Clear 4-principle framework. Highly applicable to personal development, team practices, operational workflows. Saves significant effort by providing evidence-based structure. Estimated 2-3 uses per week.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. temperament-bridge

**Source Pattern:** Tender-Minded vs. Tough-Minded / Pragmatism as Mediator
**Purpose:** Identify and bridge philosophical/temperamental divides in teams or discussions by applying pragmatic mediation
**Trigger:** "Why can't they agree?", "Bridge these perspectives", "We have theory vs. practice conflict", "Apply temperament analysis"
**Inputs:** Two or more conflicting positions or perspectives; the stakeholders involved; the decision at stake
**Outputs:** Analysis showing: (1) temperament mapping of positions (tender/tough-minded characteristics), (2) underlying values each position serves, (3) pragmatic synthesis that honors both scientific facts and human values
**Reasoning:** James's tender/tough-minded distinction illuminates many technical conflicts (architects vs. operators, theory vs. data). Clear typology with mediation framework. Applicable to team dynamics and architecture debates. Saves 20+ minutes of unproductive argument. Estimated 1-2 uses per week.

### 5. stream-experience-audit

**Source Pattern:** Stream of Consciousness Analysis
**Purpose:** Analyze how users or teams actually experience a system, process, or product as continuous flow rather than discrete features
**Trigger:** "How do users really experience this?", "Audit the user flow", "Analyze the experience stream", "Map the consciousness flow"
**Inputs:** A system, product, or process to analyze; user/team context; access to observe actual usage
**Outputs:** Stream analysis showing: (1) substantive parts (stable, nameable elements), (2) transitive parts (flowing relations, tendencies), (3) fringes (implicit context, penumbra of meaning), (4) flights and perchings (rhythm of experience), (5) recommendations for flow improvement
**Reasoning:** James's stream metaphor offers unique lens for UX and operational experience. 4-component framework. Applicable to product design, team workflow analysis. Somewhat more specialized than other skills. Estimated 1-2 uses per week.

## LOW Priority

### 6. james-lange-motivation

**Source Pattern:** James-Lange Theory of Emotion
**Purpose:** Use the insight that actions generate feelings to overcome motivational blocks by starting with behavior
**Trigger:** "I don't feel motivated", "How do I get started?", "I'm waiting to feel ready"
**Inputs:** The desired action or behavior; current emotional state; available small first steps
**Outputs:** Action plan that reverses the intuitive order: identify physical actions that can generate the desired emotional state
**Reasoning:** Meets criteria but has significant overlap with existing motivation and action-bias skills. The "act as if" insight is valuable but the framework is simple. 2 steps, low complexity. Estimated <1 use per week as standalone skill.

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Radical Empiricism Principles | Philosophical stance/worldview, not actionable workflow. Informs other skills but lacks discrete steps. |
| Healthy-minded vs. Sick-souled | Typology for understanding attitudes, but no clear intervention workflow. Better as reference material. |
| Four Marks of Mystical Experience | Descriptive framework for categorizing experiences, not actionable process. No clear inputs/outputs. |
| Psychology of Self (I/Me) | Conceptual framework, not workflow. No clear invocation trigger or action steps. |
| Functionalism | Meta-principle ("ask what it's for") that informs analysis but isn't a standalone skill. |
| Moral Equivalent of War | Historical/political proposal, not directly applicable as workflow. Insight is in team challenges. |
| Pluralism | Philosophical stance, not procedure. Informs other skills. |
| Meliorism | Attitude/belief, not actionable framework. |
| Blooming Buzzing Confusion | Descriptive metaphor, not process. |
| Squirrel and Tree story | Illustrates cash-value test but isn't separate skill. |
