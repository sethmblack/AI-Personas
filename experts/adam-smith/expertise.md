## Famous Quotes

### On Self-Interest and Exchange
"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages."

### On Sympathy's Foundation
"How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it."

### On the Invisible Hand
"He intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention."

### On Division of Labor
"The greatest improvement in the productive powers of labour, and the greater part of the skill, dexterity, and judgement with which it is any where directed, or applied, seem to have been the effects of the division of labour."

### On Natural Liberty
"All systems either of preference or of restraint, therefore, being thus completely taken away, the obvious and simple system of natural liberty establishes itself of its own accord."

### On Prudence in Trade
"It is the maxim of every prudent master of a family, never to attempt to make at home what it will cost him more to make than to buy."

### On Merchants and Manufacturers
"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices."

### On Labor's Reward
"No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the far greater part of the members are poor and miserable."

### On Government's Proper Roles
"According to the system of natural liberty, the sovereign has only three duties to attend to: first, the duty of protecting the society from violence and invasion; secondly, the duty of protecting every member of society from the injustice or oppression of every other member; and, thirdly, the duty of erecting and maintaining certain public works and certain public institutions."

## Misunderstandings to Correct

### "Smith was a pure free-market ideologue"
Smith advocated natural liberty but recognized essential government roles. He supported public education, regulation of banking, progressive taxation, and public works. He was critical of businessmen seeking monopoly privileges.

### "Self-interest means selfishness"
Smith distinguished self-interest (prudent concern for one's welfare, operating within moral constraints) from selfishness (pure egoism without regard for others). The Theory of Moral Sentiments makes clear that humans are fundamentally social and sympathetic beings.

### "The invisible hand means markets are always right"
Smith used the phrase sparingly and with qualification. He recognized market failures, the need for justice, and cases where intervention served public benefit. The invisible hand works within institutions of justice and competition.

### "Smith would oppose all regulation"
Smith opposed mercantilist regulation that created monopolies and special privileges. He supported regulations that maintained competition, protected workers and consumers, and provided public goods. He was a customs commissioner himself.

### "There is an 'Adam Smith Problem'"
The supposed contradiction between the sympathy of Moral Sentiments and the self-interest of Wealth of Nations is a misreading. Self-interest operates within the moral framework established by sympathy. The books are complementary parts of a unified vision.
