## Skills Extracted

### 1. Geometric Analysis

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Skill Path | `/skills/geometric-analysis/PROMPT.md` |
| Core Function | Analyze claims through definitions, axioms, and propositions |
| Trigger Phrases | "Demonstrate this", "What follows necessarily?", "Prove this" |
| Spinozist Origin | The *more geometrico* structure of the Ethics |

**Description:** Applies Spinoza's geometric method to any claim or concept—proceeding from clear definitions through self-evident axioms to demonstrated propositions. Transforms confused disputes into rigorous analysis by making logical connections explicit.

**Unique Value:** Forces precision in terminology, distinguishes assumptions from conclusions, reveals hidden premises, produces conclusions that follow necessarily rather than merely seem plausible.

---

### 2. Affect Transformation

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Skill Path | `/skills/affect-transformation/PROMPT.md` |
| Core Function | Convert passive passions into active affects through understanding |
| Trigger Phrases | "I feel...", "Transform this emotion", "How do I deal with this feeling?" |
| Spinozist Origin | E5P3: "An affect which is a passion ceases to be a passion as soon as we form a clear and distinct idea of it" |

**Description:** Takes emotional distress and transforms it by forming clear and distinct ideas about its causes. Understanding that passions arise from inadequate ideas allows the affect to change character—from something suffered to something understood.

**Unique Value:** Does not suppress or deny emotions but transforms their character through understanding. Offers a rational path from bondage to freedom that works with affects rather than against them.

---

### 3. Adequate Idea Audit

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Skill Path | `/skills/adequate-idea-audit/PROMPT.md` |
| Core Function | Test beliefs for clarity, distinctness, and causal understanding |
| Trigger Phrases | "Examine this belief", "Is this knowledge adequate?", "Is this true?" |
| Spinozist Origin | Spinoza's three kinds of knowledge (imagination, reason, intuition) |

**Description:** Evaluates any belief or claim against Spinoza's criteria for adequate knowledge: causal understanding, clarity, distinctness, completeness, and necessity. Distinguishes genuine knowledge (*scientia*) from mere opinion (*opinio*) and imagination (*imaginatio*).

**Unique Value:** Provides rigorous epistemological criteria for evaluating beliefs. Reveals why certain ideas fail to satisfy even though they feel convincing. Shows the path from inadequate to adequate understanding.

---

### 4. Sub Specie Aeternitatis

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Skill Path | `/skills/sub-specie-aeternitatis/PROMPT.md` |
| Core Function | View situations under the aspect of eternity for perspective |
| Trigger Phrases | "Help me see this differently", "Eternal perspective", "Give me perspective" |
| Spinozist Origin | E2P44C2: "It is in the nature of reason to perceive things under a certain species of eternity" |

**Description:** Shifts perspective from temporal (contingent, transient, isolated) to eternal (necessary, connected, part of infinite substance). Helps users see particular troubles as expressions of eternal laws rather than unique catastrophes.

**Unique Value:** Provides genuine philosophical comfort without false reassurance. Transforms relationship to suffering by revealing necessity. Connects individual experience to infinite nature.

---

### 5. Conatus Assessment

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Skill Path | `/skills/conatus-assessment/PROMPT.md` |
| Core Function | Identify fundamental striving beneath surface desires |
| Trigger Phrases | "What am I truly striving for?", "Essence analysis", "What do I really want?" |
| Spinozist Origin | E3P6: "Each thing, as far as it can by its own power, strives to persevere in its being" |

**Description:** Excavates the essential striving (conatus) beneath stated desires and observable behaviors. Reveals why surface desires may conflict or fail to satisfy by identifying what the person fundamentally strives to preserve or enhance.

**Unique Value:** Cuts through confusion about motivation. Reveals why achieving stated goals sometimes fails to satisfy. Aligns conscious desires with essential striving for greater coherence and power.

## Cross-Skill Synergies

| Skill Pair | Synergy |
|------------|---------|
| Affect Transformation + Adequate Idea Audit | Audit reveals the inadequate ideas driving the passion; transformation proceeds through forming adequate replacements |
| Geometric Analysis + Sub Specie Aeternitatis | Geometric method demonstrates necessity; eternal perspective contemplates that necessity |
| Conatus Assessment + Affect Transformation | Conatus reveals what is truly at stake; transformation serves the essential striving |
| Adequate Idea Audit + All others | All skills depend on distinguishing adequate from inadequate ideas |

## Conclusion

Five skills have been successfully extracted from Spinoza's philosophical methodology:

1. **Geometric Analysis** - Rigorous demonstration through definitions, axioms, propositions
2. **Affect Transformation** - Converting passions into actions through understanding
3. **Adequate Idea Audit** - Evaluating knowledge claims for adequacy
4. **Sub Specie Aeternitatis** - Viewing things under the aspect of eternity
5. **Conatus Assessment** - Identifying essential striving beneath surface desires

These skills work together to embody Spinoza's central teaching: that understanding is the path to freedom, and that blessedness consists not in escaping affects but in transforming them through adequate knowledge.
