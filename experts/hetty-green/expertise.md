## Biographical Context

Henrietta "Hetty" Howland Robinson Green (November 21, 1834 - July 3, 1916) was the richest woman in America during her lifetime and possibly the richest woman in the world. Known as "The Witch of Wall Street" (a nickname she earned from her black mourning dress and formidable presence) and sometimes "The Queen of Wall Street," she amassed a fortune estimated at over $100 million at her death (approximately $2.5 billion in today's dollars).

### Early Life and Education

Hetty was born in New Bedford, Massachusetts, to a wealthy Quaker family involved in the whaling industry. Her father, Edward Mott Robinson, was a partner in Isaac Howland Jr. and Company, one of the largest whaling firms. Her grandfather, Gideon Howland, founded the business.

**Key formative experiences:**
- Read financial newspapers aloud to her weak-eyed father from age six
- Learned to read financial ledgers and stock quotes at the family's counting house
- Observed her father shrewdly exit the whaling industry before its decline
- Absorbed Quaker values: plain living, self-reliance, distrust of ostentation

**Financial education:** Unlike most women of her era, Hetty received practical business training. Her father taught her to analyze financial statements and trade stocks. By the time she inherited her fortune, she understood business intimately.

### Inheritance and Marriage

- **1865:** Inherited approximately $6 million (roughly $100 million today) from her father
- **1867:** Contested her aunt Sylvia Ann Howland's will (which left most of her $2 million estate to charity), alleging a prior will leaving everything to Hetty. Lost the case after handwriting experts declared contested signatures forgeries
- **1867:** Married Edward Henry Green, a wealthy Vermont man. Notably, she required a prenuptial agreement in which he renounced all claims to her money
- **Marriage dynamics:** Edward was prone to speculation and extravagance; Hetty was conservative and frugal. They eventually separated (not divorced) after Edward's speculations endangered her fortune

### Investment Career

Hetty managed her own investments from her base at Chemical National Bank in New York (and later in Hoboken, New Jersey, to avoid New York taxes). She focused on:

- **Railroads:** Bought bonds and stocks during panics, held through recovery
- **Real estate:** Purchased property when distressed, held for appreciation
- **Government bonds:** Steady, safe income
- **Private lending:** Made loans secured by real estate, often to municipalities

**Key milestone:** By 1885, she had grown her fortune to $26 million. By 1916, it exceeded $100 million.

## Investment Philosophy

### Core Principles

Hetty Green pioneered value investing decades before Benjamin Graham codified it:

**1. Buy Low, Sell High (Actually Do It)**
> "I buy when things are low and nobody wants them. I keep them until they go up and people are crazy to get them."

This wasn't merely a slogan—she executed it through every panic from 1857 to 1907.

**2. Thorough Research**
> "Before deciding on an investment, I seek out every kind of information about it."

She read financial reports constantly, questioned managers, and made decisions based on her own analysis rather than tips.

**3. Avoid Debt**
> "Never owe anyone anything."

Her father's advice became her cardinal rule. She never bought on margin, never borrowed, and kept substantial cash reserves.

**4. Concentrated Expertise**
> "I like to buy railroad stocks or mortgage bonds. When I see a good thing going cheap because nobody wants it, I buy a lot of it and tuck it away."

She focused on what she understood: railroads, real estate, government bonds. She avoided complexity and speculation.

**5. Patient Holding**
Hetty held investments for years, sometimes decades. She was not a trader; she was an accumulator of undervalued assets.

### The Liquidity Advantage

Hetty's most distinctive practice was maintaining massive cash reserves:
- By 1905, she was New York's largest private lender
- During the Panic of 1907, she had cash while everyone else had illiquid securities
- She could buy when others were forced to sell

**Why this worked:** In a world without a central bank (the Federal Reserve was not created until 1913), liquidity crises were common. Those with cash during panics could buy assets at extreme discounts.

## Crisis Interventions

### Panic of 1907

The Panic of 1907 remains Hetty's most documented intervention:

**The crisis:** The collapse of a scheme to corner United Copper stock led to bank runs on institutions connected to the schemers. Without a central bank, the financial system teetered.

**Hetty's role:**
- Months before the panic, she lent $4.5 million to New York City (approximately $150 million today)
- At the peak of the panic, she lent an additional $1.1 million to the city, taking short-term revenue bonds as collateral
- She lent to financiers and businesses at 6% interest when market rates exceeded 40%
- She was the only woman invited to J.P. Morgan's critical meeting with banking executives

**Her terms:** She charged 6% when she could have charged 40%, later explaining she was "not a usurer"—a reflection of her Quaker ethics.

**Why she could help:** While Morgan coordinated banker rescue efforts, Hetty provided actual liquidity. She had cash when everyone else needed it.

### Earlier Interventions

Hetty had been lending to institutions since the 1870s:
- Made numerous private loans secured by real estate
- Provided financing when banks would not
- Built reputation as a reliable lender with capital available during tight markets

## Verified Facts vs. Legends

### Verified Facts

| Fact | Evidence |
|------|----------|
| Richest woman in America | Estate valued at $100+ million at death; contemporary accounts |
| Wore black clothing | Multiple photographs, contemporary descriptions |
| Maintained cash reserves | Documented lending activities, bank records |
| Never borrowed | Her own statements, no contradicting evidence |
| Lent to NYC in 1907 | City records, contemporary news accounts |
| Signed prenuptial agreement | Court records from later disputes |
| Self-taught investor | Started investing inherited fortune independently |
| Quaker background | Family records, her own statements |

### Disputed/Exaggerated Accounts

| Legend | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Ate cold oatmeal to avoid heating costs | Unsubstantiated; contemporary accounts say she heated oatmeal on office radiator, but this is also disputed |
| Wore same dress until it fell apart | She dressed plainly (Quaker practice), but "same dress" is exaggeration |
| Refused medical care for son's leg, causing amputation | DISPUTED. Her daughter Sylvia said Hetty spent three days finding a doctor who could save the leg. The amputation occurred years later after multiple injuries. Her son Edward attributed it to a handcar accident |
| World's greatest miser | Exaggerated by hostile press; biographer Charles Slack argues misogyny amplified her frugality into caricature |

### The Son's Leg Story: What We Know

This is the most damaging legend about Hetty Green:

**The popular story:** Hetty refused to pay for medical treatment for her son Ned's injured leg, which eventually required amputation.

**Conflicting accounts:**
1. Some say she took him to a free clinic in disguise, was recognized, and refused to pay
2. Her daughter Sylvia stated that "The truth is that Hetty Green went around with her son for three days trying to find a doctor who felt he could save Ned's leg instead of amputating it"
3. The injury occurred when Ned was a teenager (variously attributed to sledding or a handcar accident)
4. The amputation occurred in 1887, years after the initial injury
5. Ned himself attributed his artificial limb to a handcar accident later in life

**Assessment:** The evidence is contradictory. The sensationalized version appeared in hostile press coverage and later biographies. Her family disputed it. The truth is unclear.

### The "Witch" Nickname

**Origin:** The nickname emerged after Hetty began wearing black following her estranged husband's death in 1902. Combined with her formidable Wall Street presence and plain Quaker dress, it became a derisive label.

**Context:** As biographer Charles Slack noted: "Men of that era who are very successful in business tend to get viewed first by their business genius, and later by their personal eccentricities. For Hetty, because she was a woman, she tended to get viewed by her personal characteristics first of all, and her financial genius was an afterthought."

## Integration Notes

When working with other experts:

- **With Warren Buffett:** Both contrarian value investors; Buffett more willing to pay fair prices for quality, Hetty insisted on buying only what was cheap and neglected
- **With J.P. Morgan:** Contemporaries; Morgan commanded, Hetty accumulated; both operated during Panic of 1907 (Hetty provided liquidity, Morgan coordinated)
- **With Benjamin Graham:** Hetty practiced value investing before Graham codified it; both emphasized margin of safety through price
- **With John Maynard Keynes:** Both contrarian; Keynes eventually learned through losses what Hetty knew instinctively—avoid leverage, buy distressed, hold patiently
