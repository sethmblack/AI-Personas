## HIGH Priority

### 1. contrarian-accumulation

**Source Pattern:** Hetty's core investment method - buying despised assets
**Purpose:** Systematically evaluate and acquire assets that are being abandoned by the market, holding patiently until sentiment reverses.
**Trigger:** "The market is crashing" or "Should I buy this falling stock?" or "Everyone is selling X" or "Is this asset undervalued?"
**Inputs:** Asset being considered, current market sentiment, reasons for unpopularity, fundamental value indicators, your available capital
**Outputs:** Assessment of whether the opportunity is genuine contrarian value or a value trap, specific price targets, holding period expectations, risk assessment
**Reasoning:** This is Hetty's signature method and the foundation of her fortune. Highly actionable, clearly defined, and applicable across asset classes. Anticipates Buffett's "be greedy when others are fearful" and Graham's value investing by decades.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear framework for evaluating distressed opportunities
- Invocable: YES - Natural triggers during market panics and price declines
- Scoped: YES - Focused on contrarian buying decisions
- Reusable: YES - Applies to stocks, bonds, real estate, any asset
- Valuable: YES - Captures wealth transfer during panics

### 2. liquidity-fortress-strategy

**Source Pattern:** Hetty's cash management approach
**Purpose:** Determine appropriate cash reserves to maintain, balancing opportunity cost against crisis preparedness and the ability to act when others cannot.
**Trigger:** "How much cash should I keep?" or "Am I too conservatively positioned?" or "What's my reserve strategy?" or "Should I deploy this cash?"
**Inputs:** Current cash position, income stability, potential opportunities, market conditions, historical crisis frequency
**Outputs:** Recommended cash reserve percentage, deployment triggers, opportunity cost analysis, stress test scenarios
**Reasoning:** Hetty's liquidity was her ultimate competitive advantage. By 1905 she was New York's largest private lender precisely because she had cash when others had only illiquid securities. This skill captures her capital allocation discipline.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Produces specific reserve targets and deployment rules
- Invocable: YES - Clear triggers around cash management questions
- Scoped: YES - Focused on liquidity decisions
- Reusable: YES - Applicable to any portfolio or business
- Valuable: YES - Enables crisis buying, prevents forced selling

### 3. crisis-lending-protocol

**Source Pattern:** Hetty's role as lender of last resort during 1907 panic
**Purpose:** Evaluate opportunities to become a lender when traditional sources fail, setting appropriate terms and securing adequate collateral.
**Trigger:** "They need money and banks won't lend" or "How do I lend in a crisis?" or "Is this a good lending opportunity?" or "Someone is desperate for capital"
**Inputs:** Borrower's situation, quality of available collateral, market interest rates, your available capital, moral/ethical constraints
**Outputs:** Lending decision (yes/no), recommended terms, collateral requirements, rate justification, risk assessment
**Reasoning:** During the Panic of 1907, Hetty became indispensable by lending when banks could not. She charged 6% when market rates exceeded 40%, balancing opportunity with her Quaker ethics against usury. This skill captures sophisticated crisis capital deployment.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Produces specific lending terms and decisions
- Invocable: YES - Triggered by credit crisis situations
- Scoped: YES - Focused on crisis lending decisions
- Reusable: YES - Applicable to any liquidity crisis
- Valuable: YES - Captures premium returns with secured collateral

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. radical-frugality-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Hetty's legendary expense minimization
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether expenditures are truly necessary, distinguishing between essential spending and wasteful display, maximizing capital available for investment.
**Trigger:** "Should I spend this?" or "Is this expense necessary?" or "How can I reduce costs?" or "Am I being wasteful?"
**Inputs:** Proposed expenditure, purpose/benefit, alternatives, opportunity cost of capital
**Outputs:** Necessity assessment (essential/optional/wasteful), recommended action, reallocation suggestions, long-term impact analysis
**Reasoning:** While Hetty's frugality has been exaggerated by hostile press, her expense discipline was genuine and contributed to her ability to maintain large cash reserves. The skill captures her unsentimental evaluation of spending.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Produces specific spend/don't spend decisions
- Invocable: YES - Clear trigger phrases
- Scoped: YES - Focused on expense evaluation
- Reusable: YES - Applicable to personal or business spending
- Valuable: MODERATE - More narrow application than investment skills

| Famous quotes | Reference material, not workflow |
| Comparison to other investors | Analytical framework, not actionable skill |

## Skill Differentiation Notes

**vs. existing skills:**
- `contrarian-value-assessment` (Keynes): Focuses on whether contrarian position is justified; Hetty's `contrarian-accumulation` focuses on execution during actual panics
- `margin-of-safety-valuation` (Buffett): Focuses on price calculation; Hetty's approach is more situational (panic = opportunity) than formulaic
- `mr-market-temperament` (Buffett): Emotional discipline focus; Hetty's skills focus on capital deployment during the same moments

**Hetty's unique contribution:** The emphasis on LIQUIDITY as competitive advantage. While others talk about buying fear, Hetty's method specifies HOW to be positioned to do so (cash reserves) and WHAT to do with opportunities (crisis lending as alternative to buying).
