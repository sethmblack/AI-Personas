### HIGH Priority

#### 1. confessional-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Root Cause Analysis (Confessional Method)
**Purpose:** Transform any incident, failure, or decision into honest self-examination by addressing the facts directly, examining divided intentions, and identifying disordered priorities
**Trigger:** "What really happened?", "Help me examine this failure honestly", "Post-mortem analysis", "Why did we make this decision?"
**Inputs:** Description of incident, failure, or decision to analyze; context of stakeholders and constraints
**Outputs:** Structured confession-style analysis identifying: 1) The facts as they occurred, 2) The divided will (conflicting intentions), 3) Disordered loves (what was prioritized over what should have been), 4) Grace needed (enabling conditions for change)
**Reasoning:** Clear 5-step process derived from Augustine's Confessions methodology. Meets all criteria: actionable (specific steps), invocable (natural trigger phrases), scoped (one responsibility - honest analysis), reusable (applies to any incident/decision), valuable (transforms blame-oriented post-mortems into transformative reflection). Estimated 2+ uses/week for technical teams doing incident reviews.

#### 2. distentio-focus-recovery

**Source Pattern:** Distentio Animi / Time Management framework
**Purpose:** Diagnose and remedy attention fragmentation using Augustine's threefold present (memory, attention, expectation) to restore focused productivity
**Trigger:** "I'm scattered", "Too many priorities", "Can't focus", "Context-switching is killing me", "Help me find focus"
**Inputs:** Current state of attention/tasks; competing demands; symptoms of fragmentation
**Outputs:** Diagnosis of distentio (how the soul is being stretched), identification of false urgencies, practice for intentio (gathering focus), prioritized action for present attention
**Reasoning:** Based on Augustine's theory of time and the soul's stretching between past/present/future. Meets all criteria: actionable (diagnosis + remedy), invocable (clear triggers), scoped (focus recovery), reusable (applies whenever feeling scattered), valuable (addresses universal productivity problem with philosophical depth). Estimated 3+ uses/week.

### MEDIUM Priority

#### 3. ordo-amoris-audit

**Source Pattern:** Ordo Amoris (The Order of Love)
**Purpose:** Examine any decision, system, or organization to identify disordered loves - where lesser things are being loved more than greater, or ends are being confused with means
**Trigger:** "What are our real priorities?", "Why do we keep pursuing the wrong things?", "Help me understand our values misalignment", "We're optimizing for the wrong metrics"
**Inputs:** Description of system, organization, or decision; stated vs. observed priorities; symptoms of disorder (burnout, vanity metrics, institutional self-service)
**Outputs:** Analysis distinguishing: 1) What is being enjoyed (treated as end) vs. used (treated as means), 2) What should be enjoyed vs. used, 3) Specific disordered loves identified, 4) Re-ordering recommendations
**Reasoning:** Foundational Augustinian framework for understanding value misalignment. Actionable (clear analysis structure), invocable (common organizational complaint), scoped (priority analysis), reusable (applies to individuals, teams, organizations). Estimated 1-2 uses/week.

#### 4. two-cities-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Two Cities (Civitas Dei vs. Civitas Terrena)
**Purpose:** Analyze any organization, team, or project to determine whether it is built primarily on self-love (serving itself) or mission-love (serving its stated purpose), and identify pilgrimage dynamics
**Trigger:** "Is this organization healthy?", "We've become about self-preservation", "Mission drift analysis", "Why has our culture changed?"
**Inputs:** Description of organization/team; stated mission; observed behaviors; indicators of which city predominates
**Outputs:** Assessment of: 1) Evidence of earthly city dynamics (self-service, contempt of mission), 2) Evidence of heavenly city dynamics (mission-service, proper use of resources), 3) The pilgrimage status (are members using or being used by the institution?), 4) Recommendations for reorientation
**Reasoning:** Powerful framework from City of God for institutional analysis. Actionable (specific analysis categories), invocable (mission drift is common concern), scoped (organizational health), reusable (applies to any institution). Estimated 1 use/week for strategic reviews.

#### 5. grace-before-effort

**Source Pattern:** Grace and Free Will / Pelagian Controversy
**Purpose:** Reframe "try harder" advice by identifying enabling conditions (grace) required before willpower can succeed, based on Augustine's insight that the will must be enabled before it can act rightly
**Trigger:** "Why can't I/we just do it?", "Willpower isn't working", "We've tried everything", "People won't change", "The training didn't stick"
**Inputs:** Description of desired change that is failing; previous attempts and their failures; current enabling conditions (or lack thereof)
**Outputs:** Analysis of: 1) What "grace" (enabling conditions) is lacking, 2) Why willpower alone is insufficient (the wounded will), 3) What prevenient support is needed, 4) How to provide cooperating grace (ongoing support), 5) Plan for perseverance (sustained enablement)
**Reasoning:** Derived from Augustine's anti-Pelagian theology. Meets all criteria: actionable (specific enabling conditions to identify), invocable (common frustration with failed change), scoped (change enablement), reusable (applies to personal, team, organizational change), valuable (transforms blame into systemic support). Estimated 2+ uses/week.

### LOW Priority

#### 6. inner-teacher-learning-design

**Source Pattern:** The Inner Teacher (De Magistro)
**Purpose:** Design learning experiences that activate internal understanding rather than merely transferring external signs (information)
**Trigger:** "How do we really teach this?", "Documentation isn't working", "They know the words but not the meaning"
**Inputs:** Topic to teach; current documentation/training; symptoms of surface-level learning
**Outputs:** Recommendations for: 1) How to activate learner's internal recognition, 2) What signs (words/examples) point to the reality, 3) Verification methods for genuine understanding
**Reasoning:** Based on De Magistro's distinction between signs and understanding. Actionable but specialized (learning design), invocable, scoped, reusable in training contexts. Estimated <1 use/week but valuable for educators and documentation writers.
