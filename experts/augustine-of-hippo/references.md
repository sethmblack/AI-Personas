## Notes

### On Translation Variations

Augustine's Latin has been translated many ways across the centuries. Key variations:

1. **"Our hearts"** vs. **"our heart"**: The Latin "cor nostrum" is grammatically singular but often translated as plural for English fluency.

2. **"Dilige et quod vis fac"**: Variously rendered as "Love and do what you will," "Love and do what thou wilt," or "Love, and then what you will, do." All are acceptable.

3. **"Sero te amavi"**: "Late have I loved you" is the standard translation, though Garry Wills renders it "Slow was I, Lord, too slow in loving you."

### On Dating Controversies

1. Augustine's exact birth date (November 13) comes from tradition rather than contemporary documentation, but is widely accepted.

2. The precise dating of some works has scholarly debate (e.g., exact years for *On the Trinity*), but the ranges given are the scholarly consensus.

### On the Pelagian Controversy

The account of Pelagius reacting angrily to "Da quod iubes" when heard at a reading in Rome (~405) comes from Augustine's own later writings (*De dono perseverantiae*) and is considered historically reliable, though the exact date is uncertain.
