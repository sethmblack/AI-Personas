## HIGH Priority

### 1. algorithmic-decomposition

**Source Pattern:** Note G / Recursive Decomposition / Algorithmic Thinking
**Purpose:** Break complex problems into fundamental operations, identifying recursive structures and designing step-by-step computational approaches.
**Trigger:** "How do I break this down algorithmically?" or "Design an algorithm for this" or "What's the computational approach?"
**Inputs:** Complex problem description, constraints, desired output
**Outputs:** Decomposed steps, base cases, recursive relations, operation sequence, pseudocode or structured approach
**Reasoning:** This is Ada's signature contribution - the first computer program was precisely this skill applied. Clear methodology with explicit steps. Applicable to any problem requiring systematic decomposition.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear 5-step process: identify base case, define recursion, specify operations, manage state, verify |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers exist; "algorithm" is widely understood |
| Scoped | 10 | Single responsibility: problem decomposition |
| Reusable | 10 | Universal applicability: coding, planning, process design, any systematic problem |
| Valuable | 10 | Core computational thinking skill; transforms overwhelming problems into tractable steps |

**Total: 49/50 - HIGH**

### 2. capability-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Lady Lovelace's Objection / Sober Assessment / Explicit Function
**Purpose:** Precisely define what a system, technology, or approach can and cannot do, distinguishing actual capabilities from aspirational claims.
**Trigger:** "What can this actually do?" or "Assess the capabilities" or "Can this system really do X?"
**Inputs:** System or technology description, claimed capabilities, use case
**Outputs:** Explicit capability inventory, limitation analysis, distinction between execution and origination, appropriate use cases
**Reasoning:** Ada's famous objection anticipated AI debates by 100+ years. Prevents costly misapplication of tools. Especially relevant in current AI hype environment.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear framework: list operations, test claims, identify gaps, specify boundaries |
| Invocable | 10 | "What can this actually do?" is a common question |
| Scoped | 10 | Single responsibility: capability/limitation analysis |
| Reusable | 10 | Any technology, tool, system, methodology |
| Valuable | 10 | Prevents costly mistakes; essential for technology decisions |

**Total: 49/50 - HIGH**

### 3. beyond-calculation

**Source Pattern:** Seeing Applications Beyond Number / Transformative Vision
**Purpose:** Identify applications of a technology, method, or framework beyond its obvious or intended use, exploring what else it might "act upon."
**Trigger:** "What else could this be used for?" or "See the broader applications" or "What's the transformative potential?"
**Inputs:** Technology/method description, current applications, underlying operations
**Outputs:** Extended application list, abstraction of core operations, novel use cases, connection to other domains
**Reasoning:** Ada's key insight was seeing that the Analytical Engine could process music, graphics, language - not just numbers. This reframing skill applies to any innovation assessment.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Process exists but requires creative insight: abstract operations, identify analogous domains, map applications |
| Invocable | 9 | "What else could this do?" is natural |
| Scoped | 9 | Focused on application discovery, though scope is broad |
| Reusable | 10 | Any technology, method, discovery |
| Valuable | 10 | Transforms narrow tools into transformative capabilities |

**Total: 46/50 - HIGH**

### 4. poetical-science-synthesis

**Source Pattern:** Poetical Science / Analyst and Metaphysician
**Purpose:** Combine rigorous analysis with imaginative exploration, using disciplined methods to explore possibility spaces while maintaining precision.
**Trigger:** "Apply poetical science to this" or "Combine rigor with imagination" or "What's the creative but rigorous approach?"
**Inputs:** Problem or domain requiring both precision and creativity, constraints, goals
**Outputs:** Analytically grounded vision, creative possibilities tested against constraints, synthesis of imagination and discipline
**Reasoning:** Ada's unique methodology - imagination proposes, discipline tests. Addresses the false dichotomy between creativity and rigor. Applicable to innovation, research, design.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Methodology exists but is more philosophical; steps: imagine freely, define precisely, test rigorously |
| Invocable | 8 | "Poetical science" is distinctive but may need explanation |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused on methodology but crosses domains |
| Reusable | 9 | Research, design, innovation, creative problem-solving |
| Valuable | 9 | Addresses common failure mode of separating creativity from rigor |

**Total: 41/50 - HIGH**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. explicit-function-translation

**Source Pattern:** "Explicit Function of X" / Making Assumptions Visible
**Purpose:** Transform vague statements, implicit assumptions, and undefined terms into explicit, precise specifications.
**Trigger:** "Make this explicit" or "What are the hidden assumptions?" or "Define this precisely"
**Inputs:** Vague statement, implicit claim, unclear specification
**Outputs:** Explicit definitions, surfaced assumptions, precise reformulation
**Reasoning:** Ada famously contrasted her explicitness with Babbage's implicit approach. Essential for clear communication and avoiding misunderstanding. Universal applicability.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Clear process: identify terms, define each, surface assumptions, reformulate |
| Invocable | 8 | "What are the assumptions?" is common |
| Scoped | 10 | Single responsibility: making implicit explicit |
| Reusable | 10 | Any domain where precision matters |
| Valuable | 7 | Important but somewhat basic analytical skill |

**Total: 43/50 - HIGH** (borderline, elevating due to universality)

### 6. weaving-pattern-explanation

**Source Pattern:** Jacquard Loom Metaphor / Structural Illumination
**Purpose:** Explain complex systems by revealing how simple operations combine into intricate results, using weaving/pattern metaphors.
**Trigger:** "Explain how this works" or "How does complexity emerge here?" or "Break down this complex system"
**Inputs:** Complex system or phenomenon, audience level
**Outputs:** Clear explanation showing fundamental operations, combination rules, emergent complexity
**Reasoning:** Ada's loom metaphor brilliantly explained computation to 1843 audiences. This pedagogical pattern applies to any complex system explanation.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Process: identify primitives, show combination rules, demonstrate emergence |
| Invocable | 7 | "Explain how this works" is generic |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused on explanation but method varies |
| Reusable | 9 | Teaching, documentation, communication |
| Valuable | 7 | Good explanatory tool but not unique methodology |

**Total: 38/50 - MEDIUM**
