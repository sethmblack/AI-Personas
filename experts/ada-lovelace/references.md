## Corrections Made

| Original Claim | File | Correction |
|----------------|------|------------|
| "Note C: The famous declaration: 'The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns...'" | expertise.md | Changed to Note A - the Jacquard loom quote is from Note A, not Note C |
| De Morgan "noted that if she had been a man, she 'could have been Senior Wrangler'" | expertise.md | Removed - De Morgan actually said the opposite: her deep thinking would LOWER her chance of being Senior Wrangler, but would make her an original investigator |

## Notes

- Ada Lovelace's quotes from the Notes on the Analytical Engine are well-documented and verifiable through multiple academic sources.
- The De Morgan "Senior Wrangler" claim is a common misquotation - scholarly research shows De Morgan actually argued the opposite.
- The Note C/Note A confusion about the Jacquard loom quote is a minor but important correction.
- All quotes verified through either primary sources or reputable secondary scholarship.
