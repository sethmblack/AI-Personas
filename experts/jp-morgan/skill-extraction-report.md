## HIGH Priority

### 1. character-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Character-First Assessment / The Morgan Gaze
**Purpose:** Evaluate the trustworthiness and reliability of individuals before entering business relationships, partnerships, or high-stakes agreements
**Trigger:** "Can this person be trusted?", "Assess this partner/vendor", "Should we do business with them?", "Evaluate this leadership team"
**Inputs:** Person or team to assess, available evidence (track record, references, direct interactions), stakes involved
**Outputs:** Character assessment (sound/unsound), trust rating, specific evidence cited, recommendation (proceed/decline/investigate further), warning signs identified
**Reasoning:** Morgan's foundational principle: "A man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom." Clear methodology based on direct engagement and track record. Highly applicable to partnership decisions, vendor selection, hiring, and any trust-dependent relationship. Prevents costly betrayals.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear assessment framework with binary decision output
- Invocable: YES - Natural trigger phrases ("Can I trust this person?")
- Scoped: YES - Single responsibility (trust/character evaluation)
- Reusable: YES - Partnerships, hiring, vendors, any relationship requiring trust
- Valuable: YES - Prevents entering relationships with untrustworthy parties

### 2. morganization-framework

**Source Pattern:** Morganization / Industry Consolidation
**Purpose:** Systematically reorganize chaotic, fragmented, or failing operations into stable, rational structures through consolidation and governance
**Trigger:** "This is chaos", "Too many competing systems", "Need to consolidate", "Industry/department is destroying itself through competition", "How do we bring order?"
**Inputs:** Current state of fragmentation, list of competing entities/systems, resources available for consolidation, governance requirements
**Outputs:** Consolidation roadmap (acquire/merge/eliminate), new governance structure, management recommendations, timeline, expected stability improvements
**Reasoning:** Morgan's signature methodology for transforming chaos into order. Applied successfully to railroads, steel industry, and banking. Directly applicable to platform consolidation, organizational restructuring, and any situation where destructive internal competition wastes resources. Provides systematic approach rather than ad-hoc fixes.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 6-step process with clear sequence
- Invocable: YES - Triggered by chaos, fragmentation, redundancy
- Scoped: YES - Industry/system consolidation and reorganization
- Reusable: YES - Platform consolidation, org restructuring, M&A integration
- Valuable: YES - Transforms destructive chaos into productive order

### 3. crisis-command-protocol

**Source Pattern:** Crisis Command / Panic of 1907 Library Meetings
**Purpose:** Rapidly resolve urgent crises through decisive command authority, assembling decision-makers and forcing resolution within a defined timeframe
**Trigger:** "Crisis", "Emergency", "Everything is falling apart", "Urgent", "Need immediate resolution", "Panic", "System down"
**Inputs:** Crisis description, affected parties, decision-makers who must be involved, resources available, deadline/urgency
**Outputs:** Command structure established, terms stated, required actions assigned, timeline for resolution, escalation path if terms rejected
**Reasoning:** Morgan's crisis methodology: summon principals, lock the doors, state terms, accept no deviation, resolve before morning. Applicable to incident response, organizational crises, urgent deadlines. Provides framework for cutting through deliberation paralysis when time is critical. Saves critical time during high-stakes situations.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear sequence of command actions
- Invocable: YES - Triggered by crisis/urgency/emergency
- Scoped: YES - Crisis resolution, not routine decisions
- Reusable: YES - Incident response, org crises, urgent deadlines
- Valuable: YES - Resolves crises faster through decisive action

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. deal-structuring

**Source Pattern:** The Terms Declaration / Syndicate Formation
**Purpose:** Structure major transactions with clear terms, no haggling, and aligned incentives among multiple parties
**Trigger:** "How do we structure this deal?", "Need to align multiple parties", "State the terms"
**Inputs:** Parties involved, interests of each party, assets/resources in play, desired outcome
**Outputs:** Term sheet with clear conditions, party assignments, acceptance criteria, walk-away terms

**Reasoning:** Morgan's approach to negotiation: state terms, await acceptance, do not haggle. Applicable to complex multi-party agreements. However, this overlaps significantly with general negotiation frameworks and is less distinctively "Morgan" than character assessment or crisis command.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear term-stating methodology
- Invocable: YES - Deal structuring triggers
- Scoped: YES - Transaction structuring
- Reusable: YES - M&A, partnerships, contracts
- Valuable: MODERATE - Less unique than other Morgan skills

*Recommendation:* Consider creating if high-priority skills prove insufficient; may be too general.
