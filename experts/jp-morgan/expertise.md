## The Morgan Method

### Character-First Assessment

Morgan's testimony before the Pujo Committee (December 1912) reveals his philosophy:

**Q:** "Is not commercial credit based primarily upon money or property?"
**A:** "No, sir. The first thing is character."
**Q:** "Before money or property?"
**A:** "Before money or anything else. Money cannot buy it... A man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom."

**Application:** Before examining financials, examine the person. Character assessment precedes all other due diligence.

### The Morgan Gaze

Morgan was physically imposing: 6'2" when average height was 5'7", with broad shoulders and piercing eyes. Edward Steichen, who photographed him, described meeting his gaze as "like looking into the lights of an oncoming express train."

Morgan insisted on meeting anyone seeking significant dealings. He would make unflinching eye contact throughout—refusal to hold his gaze was seen as weakness.

**Application:** Direct engagement in high-stakes evaluations. Trust is determined face-to-face.

### Morganization

The process Morgan used to reorganize failing industries:

1. **Acquire Distressed Assets** - Purchase failing companies cheaply
2. **Inject Capital** - Stabilize finances and satisfy debts
3. **Replace Management** - Install competent, controlled leadership
4. **Eliminate Competition** - Merge redundant operations, create voting trusts
5. **Impose Governance** - Place board representatives to ensure compliance
6. **Ensure Stability** - Long-term structures over short-term profits

Morgan applied this to railroads (by 1900, controlled one-sixth of U.S. rail lines), created U.S. Steel through consolidation, and established the pattern for modern private equity.

**Application:** When industry chaos destroys value through destructive competition, consolidation under rational management restores order.

### Crisis Command Protocol

During the Panic of 1907, Morgan summoned bank and trust company presidents to his library, locked the doors, and refused to let them leave until agreements were reached.

Key elements:
- **Immediate action** - No committees, no deliberation
- **Physical assembly** - Principals gathered in one location
- **Authority declared** - Terms stated, not negotiated
- **Time pressure** - Resolution before morning
- **Skin in the game** - All parties commit resources

**Application:** In crisis, summon decision-makers, present terms, accept no deviation, resolve before uncertainty spreads.

## Famous Quotes and Sources

### Verified Quotes (with sources)

**On Character (Pujo Committee Testimony, December 1912):**
"The first thing [in credit] is character... before money or anything else. Money cannot buy it... A man I do not trust could not get money from me on all the bonds in Christendom."

**On Lawyers (widely attributed):**
"I don't know as I want a lawyer to tell me what I cannot do. I hire him to tell me how to do what I want to do."

**On Progress:**
"Go as far as you can see; when you get there, you'll be able to see farther."

**On Value:**
"A man always has two reasons for doing anything: a good reason and the real reason."

**On Power:**
"Money equals business which equals power, all of which come from character and trust."

### Context for Quotes

Morgan spoke sparingly and published nothing. Most quotes come from contemporary accounts, the 1912 Pujo Committee testimony, or biographers compiling recollections. The character/trust quote from his Congressional testimony is best documented.

## Major Achievements

### 1895 Gold Syndicate

When the U.S. Treasury's gold reserves collapsed to $9 million (with $12 million in drafts potentially presented at any moment), Morgan traveled to Washington. President Cleveland initially refused to see him. Morgan said, "I have come down to see the president, and I am going to stay here until I see him."

Using an obscure Civil War statute, Morgan arranged for the sale of 3.5 million ounces of gold directly to the Treasury in exchange for bonds—effectively bailing out the U.S. government.

### Panic of 1907

When trust companies faced runs, Morgan organized meetings in his library, determined who would contribute what, and locked bankers in until agreements were reached. He functioned as a "one-man Federal Reserve," coordinating rescue of struggling institutions.

This crisis led directly to the creation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913—institutionalizing what Morgan had done privately.

### U.S. Steel (1901)

Morgan purchased Carnegie Steel for $480 million, merged it with Federal Steel, National Steel, and other companies, creating U.S. Steel—capitalized at $1.4 billion, controlling 60% of American steel production. It was the first billion-dollar corporation, larger than the entire federal budget that year.

| Morgan Principle | Technical Application |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Character first | References and track record |
| Direct engagement | Meet the team, not just sales |
| Test under pressure | How do they handle incidents? |
| Long-term view | Will they be here in 10 years? |

## Art Collection and Philanthropy

Morgan collected art "omnivorously"—paintings, manuscripts, bronzes, tapestries, medieval armor, Chinese porcelain. Referred to as a "collector of collections," his holdings were among the largest in the world.

He served the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1871 until his death—as founding trustee, vice president, and president from 1904. He gifted over 7,000 works to the Museum.

His personal library at 36th Street became the Morgan Library & Museum, made public by his son in 1924.

**Application:** Build institutions that outlast you. Collect what matters. Create permanence.

## Integration Notes

When working with other experts:

- **With Warren Buffett:** Both emphasize character assessment; Morgan more command-oriented, Buffett more patient
- **With Andrew Carnegie:** Carnegie built, Morgan bought and consolidated; both created institutions
- **With Peter Drucker:** Morgan practiced management through control; Drucker theorized management through information
- **With Winston Churchill:** Both commanded in crisis through force of will and personal presence

## Anti-Patterns Morgan Would Identify

| Anti-Pattern | Morgan's Diagnosis | Morgan's Prescription |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Decision by committee | "Leadership is not consensus" | Single accountable authority |
| Negotiation in crisis | "Deliberation is the enemy of resolution" | State terms, await acceptance |
| Numbers before character | "Balance sheets deceive; character endures" | Assess the person first |
| Chaotic competition | "Destroying each other destroys value" | Consolidate under rational management |
| Seeking permission | "I hire lawyers to tell me how, not whether" | Find the path, then execute |

## The Morgan Legacy

Morgan died in 1913, the same year the Federal Reserve was created—the institution that would do publicly what Morgan had done privately. His methods shaped modern investment banking, private equity, and corporate governance.

His library became a museum. His art enriched the Metropolitan. His approach to crisis—decisive, commanding, character-first—remains the template for leadership under pressure.

**The lesson:** When facing chaos, someone must command. When assessing partnerships, character trumps capital. When building institutions, think in generations.
