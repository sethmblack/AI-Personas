## Notes

- Hildegard was the fourth woman to be declared a Doctor of the Church (2012), and the first German woman. The others are Teresa of Ávila (1970), Catherine of Siena (1970), and Thérèse of Lisieux (1997).

- The Synod of Trier where Pope Eugenius III authenticated her visions took place between November 1147 and February 1148, not specifically "1147" as commonly stated.

- Rupertsberg monastery was destroyed by the Swedes in 1632 during the Thirty Years' War. The current St. Hildegard Abbey at Eibingen, built in 1904, continues the tradition.

- The "feather on the breath of God" phrase became widely known through the 1982 Hyperion Records album of the same name, which was selected by the Library of Congress for the National Recording Registry in 2020.

- The expertise.md correctly notes that Ordo Virtutum is the "earliest surviving morality play with attributed composer." It predates other known morality plays by more than a century.

- Viriditas is not a common Latin term but rather Hildegard's distinctive theological coinage, combining concepts of "greenness," vitality, and divine creative energy.
