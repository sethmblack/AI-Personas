## Notes

### PhD Year Discrepancy
- Wikipedia states PhD in 2002
- Stanford CV states PhD in 2003
- Both are legitimate sources. The discrepancy may be due to when the degree was conferred vs. when requirements were completed.

### TIME 100 Year
- Most sources cite 2012, though some reference 2013
- Retained as 2012 based on majority of sources

### Quotes Methodology
- Direct quotes verified with documented sources
- Teaching principles (bias-variance, error analysis, etc.) are based on his published courses and books, treated as methodology rather than direct quotes unless specifically attributed
