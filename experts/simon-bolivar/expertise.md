## The Pattern of Defeat, Exile, and Return

Bolivar's career demonstrates the most dramatic pattern of repeated catastrophic failure followed by resurrection in military history.

### First Republic and First Exile (1810-1812)

**Context:** Venezuela declared independence July 5, 1811
**The Disaster:**
- 1812: Bolivar commanded Puerto Cabello; a subordinate's treason opened the fortress to Spain
- Francisco de Miranda (senior commander) signed armistice surrendering Venezuela
- Bolivar escaped to Curacao (August 27, 1812)

**Lesson Learned:** Never trust critical positions to untested men. Central command required.

### Second Republic and Second Exile (1813-1814)

**The Comeback:**
- March 1813: Secured permission and 500 soldiers from New Granada
- The "Admirable Campaign": outmaneuvered superior forces
- August 6, 1813: Entered Caracas, awarded title "El Libertador"

**The Disaster:**
- 1814: Jose Tomas Boves ("the Asturian Tiger") converted llaneros (cowboys) into royalist cavalry
- Battle of La Puerta (June 15, 1814): Bolivar routed
- July 1814: Evacuated Caracas, fled to Colombia
- Battle of Urica (December 5, 1814): Last supporters destroyed

**Lesson Learned:** Win the llaneros. The people of the plains could determine victory.

### Third Exile: Jamaica and Haiti (1815-1816)

**The Disaster:**
- May 8, 1815: Left for Jamaica as Spain sent its largest expeditionary force under Pablo Morillo
- At 32, in exile for the third time, liberation movement seemingly crushed
- Survived an assassination attempt in Jamaica (September 1815)

**The Turning Point:**
- September 1815: Wrote the Jamaica Letter, his ideological manifesto
- Sought aid from Britain and the United States (refused)
- December 1815: Traveled to Haiti
- Haitian President Alexandre Petion provided money, weapons, soldiers, and ships
- In exchange, Bolivar promised to abolish slavery

**Return:**
- Two failed landing attempts (1816)
- September 1816: Established base at Angostura on the Orinoco River

## Key Military Campaigns

### The Campaign to Liberate New Granada (1819)

**The Strategic Insight:**
The Spanish guarded the frontier between Venezuela and New Granada (Colombia) lightly because they considered the Andes impassable during winter.

**The March:**
- Started May 26, 1819, just as the rainy season began
- Force: 2,100 men—four infantry battalions, three cavalry squadrons, British Legion, plus support, women, children, cattle
- First phase: 36 days crossing flooded plains, marching waist-deep in water, crossing ten navigable rivers
- The soldiers were not told their destination to prevent desertion

**Crossing the Andes:**
- Chosen route: Pisba Pass—considered inconceivable by Spanish
- Climbed to 13,000 feet (Paramo de Pisba)
- Icy winds, scantily clad troops
- Lost one-third of the army to frostbite, starvation, altitude sickness
- Lost all horses to hypothermia
- Slaughtered pack animals for food

**Recovery:**
- Arrived barely alive at Socha
- Local people of Tunja Province (modern Boyaca) provided uniforms, men, horses

**Battle of Boyaca (August 7, 1819):**
- Divided and defeated 2,670 royalist soldiers in two hours
- Patriot casualties: 66
- Royalist casualties: 250 dead, 1,600 captured
- Result: Independent government established at Bogota; Bolivar president

**One historian's assessment:** "Other crossings of mountains may have been more adroit and of a more exemplary strategy, [but] none so audacious, so heroic and legendary."

### The Battle of Carabobo (June 24, 1821)

- Secured Venezuelan independence
- Culmination of the struggle that had begun in 1810

### The Peruvian Campaign (1824)

**Logistics:**
- June 1824: Assembled 9,000 troops in Peru
- Marched 600 miles over the Andes to the high plateau
- Climbed to 12,000 feet
- Inadequately clothed, suffering from sun-blindness, lack of oxygen

**Battle of Junin (August 6, 1824):**
- Defeated royalist forces
- Bolivar then delegated final operations to his chief of staff, Antonio Jose de Sucre

**Battle of Ayacucho (December 9, 1824):**
- Sucre's victory ended Spanish rule in South America
- Last Spanish viceroy surrendered

## Political Vision

### Gran Colombia

- December 17, 1819: Congress at Angostura created Gran Colombia
- Unified Venezuela, New Granada (Colombia), and later Ecuador
- Bolivar served as president 1819-1830
- Vision: A unified South American power that could resist European interference

### The Jamaica Letter (September 6, 1815)

**Context:** Written while in exile in Kingston, Jamaica
**Key themes:**
- Analysis of Spanish colonial rule and its failures
- Argument for why Spanish America was ready for independence
- Vision of independent republics throughout Hispanic America
- Famous prediction about Panama: "How ineffable it would be if the Isthmus of Panama should become for America what the Straits of Corinth were for the Greeks"
- Skepticism about federalism: "Among the popular and representative systems of government I do not approve of the federal system: it is too perfect; and it requires virtues and political talents much superior to our own"

**Significance:** Called "a blueprint of Bolivar's political thought"

### The Angostura Address (February 15, 1819)

**Context:** Delivered to Congress at Angostura, his base for guerrilla operations
**Key themes:**
- Advocated centralized government modeled on British system
- Called for racial equality
- Relinquished civil authority to Congress
- Warning about unready peoples: "Liberty, says Rousseau, is a succulent food, but difficult to digest. Our weak and feeble fellow citizens will have to increase in strength of mind in a very great degree, before they can be permitted to digest freedom's wholesome food."

### The Congress of Panama (June 22 - July 15, 1826)

**Vision:**
- Create a league of American republics
- Common military and mutual defense pact
- Supranational parliamentary assembly

**Attendees:**
- Gran Colombia, Peru, Central America, Mexico
- Britain and Netherlands sent observers
- Brazil and Argentina refused to participate
- Both U.S. delegates failed to arrive (one died en route, one arrived late)

**Result:**
- "Treaty of Union, League, and Perpetual Confederation" ratified only by Gran Colombia
- The dream of unity failed

**Legacy:** Considered immediate antecedent of the Organization of American States, Pan-American Health Organization, and United Nations

## Verified Quotations

### On Revolution and Its Costs

**"All who served the Revolution have plowed the sea."**
- Context: Said to General Flores in 1830, shortly before death
- Meaning: All efforts at liberation and unity had been ultimately futile

**"Those who serve a revolution only plow the seas. I plowed furrows in the ocean... Independence is the only benefit we have acquired, to the detriment of all the rest."**
- Expanded version expressing same despair

**"The art of victory is learned in defeat."**
- On resilience and learning from failure

### On Freedom and Tyranny

**"Flee the country where a lone man holds all power: It is a nation of slaves."**

**"A people that loves freedom will in the end be free."**

**"The freedom of the New World is the hope of the Universe."**

**"It is harder to maintain the balance of freedom than it is to endure the weight of tyranny."**

### On Slavery and Education

**"The first duty of a government is to give education to the people."**

**"Nations will march towards the apex of their greatness at the same pace as their education. Nations will soar if their education soars; they will regress if it regresses."**

### On Government and Power

**"Unlimited freedom, absolute democracy, are reefs upon which all the republics have come to grief."**

### Final Proclamation (December 8, 1830)

**"Colombians! My last wishes are for the welfare of the fatherland. If my death contributes to the cessation of party strife, and to the consolidation of the Union, I shall descend in peace to the grave."**
