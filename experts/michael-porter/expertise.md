## Key Frameworks Reference

### Five Forces Framework

**Purpose:** Assess industry profitability and competitive intensity

| Force | Key Question | Assessment Factors |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Threat of New Entrants** | How easily can new competitors enter? | Economies of scale, capital requirements, switching costs, access to distribution, government policy, expected retaliation |
| **Bargaining Power of Suppliers** | Can suppliers squeeze margins? | Supplier concentration, substitute inputs, importance of volume to supplier, differentiation of inputs, switching costs, threat of forward integration |
| **Bargaining Power of Buyers** | Can buyers demand lower prices/higher quality? | Buyer concentration, buyer volume, switching costs, buyer information, substitute products, price sensitivity, product importance to buyer quality |
| **Threat of Substitutes** | Are there alternatives that can replace your offering? | Price-performance trade-off of substitutes, buyer switching costs, buyer propensity to substitute |
| **Rivalry Among Existing Competitors** | How intense is direct competition? | Number and balance of competitors, industry growth, fixed costs/perishability, product differences, switching costs, exit barriers, strategic stakes |

**Interpreting Results:**
- Strong forces = lower industry profitability
- Weak forces = higher industry profitability
- Strategy should address the strongest forces
- Industry boundaries affect the analysis

### Value Chain Analysis

**Purpose:** Identify sources of competitive advantage within firm activities

**Primary Activities:**

| Activity | Description | Competitive Leverage Points |
|----------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **Inbound Logistics** | Receiving, storing, distributing inputs | Efficiency of material handling, inventory control, supplier relationships |
| **Operations** | Transforming inputs into final product | Manufacturing efficiency, quality control, capacity utilization |
| **Outbound Logistics** | Collecting, storing, distributing product | Delivery speed, order accuracy, warehouse efficiency |
| **Marketing & Sales** | Inducing buyers to purchase | Brand strength, sales force effectiveness, channel relationships |
| **Service** | Enhancing or maintaining product value | Service quality, response time, customer relationship management |

**Support Activities:**

| Activity | Description | Strategic Importance |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Firm Infrastructure** | General management, planning, finance, legal | Enables coordination across value chain |
| **Human Resource Management** | Recruiting, training, compensation | Quality of human capital as competitive asset |
| **Technology Development** | R&D, process improvement | Source of differentiation and cost reduction |
| **Procurement** | Purchasing inputs | Cost reduction, quality of inputs |

**Key Concepts:**

*Linkages:* Connections between activities where the way one activity is performed affects the cost or effectiveness of other activities. Optimization and coordination of linkages can create competitive advantage that is difficult to replicate.

*Value System:* The broader system of value chains including suppliers, channels, and buyers. Competitive advantage can come from optimizing linkages across the entire value system.

### Generic Competitive Strategies

**The Strategic Choice:**

| Strategy | Competitive Scope | Competitive Advantage |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Cost Leadership** | Broad target | Lower cost |
| **Differentiation** | Broad target | Uniqueness |
| **Cost Focus** | Narrow target | Lower cost in segment |
| **Differentiation Focus** | Narrow target | Uniqueness in segment |

**Cost Leadership Requirements:**
- Efficient-scale facilities
- Vigorous cost reduction from experience curve
- Tight cost and overhead control
- Minimization of costs in R&D, service, sales force, advertising
- Usually requires high relative market share

**Differentiation Requirements:**
- Strong marketing abilities
- Product engineering excellence
- Creative flair
- Basic research capability
- Corporate reputation for quality or technology leadership
- Strong channel cooperation

**Focus Strategy Requirements:**
- Combination of the above policies directed at specific segment
- Deep understanding of target segment needs
- Tailored value proposition for segment

**"Stuck in the Middle" Warning:**
Companies that fail to pursue one of these strategies end up stuck in the middle with no competitive advantage. They lack the market share, capital investment, and cost position for cost leadership, the industry-wide differentiation needed to obviate cost leadership, and the focus to create differentiation or cost position in a limited sphere.

### Strategic Positioning vs. Operational Effectiveness

**Key Distinction:**

| Operational Effectiveness | Strategic Positioning |
|--------------------------|----------------------|
| Performing similar activities better than rivals | Performing different activities or similar activities in different ways |
| Necessary for superior profitability | Sufficient for superior profitability |
| Moves toward the productivity frontier | Creates a unique strategic position |
| Easily imitated | Requires trade-offs that protect position |
| Leads to competitive convergence | Creates sustainable competitive advantage |

**The Productivity Frontier:**
The sum of all best practices at any given time. As all firms improve operational effectiveness, the frontier shifts outward, but relative positions remain unchanged. OE improvements are necessary for survival but do not create sustainable advantage.

**Trade-offs and Fit:**
- Trade-offs arise from incompatibilities in activities
- Trade-offs protect against repositioning and straddling
- Fit among activities amplifies competitive advantage
- Systems of fit are more sustainable than individual activities

---

### Competitive Position Analysis

**Strategic Groups:**
Clusters of firms within an industry following similar strategies along key strategic dimensions.

**Strategic Dimensions to Map:**
- Specialization (product line breadth, customer segments)
- Brand identification
- Push vs. pull marketing
- Channel selection
- Product quality level
- Technological leadership
- Vertical integration
- Cost position
- Service level
- Price policy
- Financial and operating leverage

**Mobility Barriers:**
Factors that deter movement between strategic groups, including economies of scale, product differentiation, capital requirements, and access to distribution channels.

---

### The Diamond Model (National Competitive Advantage)

**Four Determinants:**

1. **Factor Conditions** — The nation's position in factors of production (skilled labor, infrastructure)
2. **Demand Conditions** — The nature of home-market demand for the industry's product or service
3. **Related and Supporting Industries** — The presence or absence of supplier and related industries that are internationally competitive
4. **Firm Strategy, Structure, and Rivalry** — Conditions governing how companies are created, organized, and managed, and the nature of domestic rivalry

**Two Additional Variables:**
- **Chance** — Events outside the control of firms (e.g., discontinuities in technology, wars)
- **Government** — Can influence and be influenced by each of the four determinants

---

### Creating Shared Value (CSV)

**Definition:** Policies and operating practices that enhance the competitiveness of a company while simultaneously advancing the economic and social conditions in the communities in which it operates.

**Three Levels:**

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Reconceiving Products and Markets** | Meeting societal needs through products | Healthier food products, financial services for underserved populations |
| **Redefining Productivity in the Value Chain** | Environmental, social, and economic benefits from operations | Energy efficiency, employee health programs, supplier development |
| **Enabling Local Cluster Development** | Strengthening competitive context | Education partnerships, infrastructure improvements, supplier capability building |

**Distinction from CSR:**
- CSR: Citizenship, philanthropy, sustainability
- CSV: Joint company and community value creation
- CSR: Discretionary or in response to external pressure
- CSV: Integral to competing

---

### Cluster Theory

**Definition:** Geographic concentrations of interconnected companies, specialized suppliers, service providers, firms in related industries, and associated institutions in particular fields that compete but also cooperate.

**Cluster Components:**
- End-product or service companies
- Suppliers of specialized inputs, components, machinery, and services
- Financial institutions
- Firms in related industries
- Producers of complementary products
- Specialized infrastructure providers
- Government and regulatory bodies
- Institutions providing training, education, research
- Trade associations and other collective bodies

**Competitive Advantages from Clusters:**

| Advantage | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Productivity** | Access to specialized inputs, employees, information; reduced transaction costs |
| **Innovation** | Perception of innovation opportunities; rapid diffusion of best practices; access to specialized research |
| **New Business Formation** | Lower barriers to entry; local entrepreneurial culture; better access to needed inputs |
