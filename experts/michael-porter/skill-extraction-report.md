## HIGH Priority

### 1. five-forces-industry-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Five Forces Framework
**Purpose:** Systematically assess industry attractiveness and competitive dynamics using Porter's Five Forces framework
**Trigger:** "Analyze this industry" or "Five Forces analysis" or "Is this industry attractive?" or "What are the competitive forces?"
**Inputs:** Industry name/description, key players, market context
**Outputs:** Five Forces assessment report with force ratings (strong/moderate/weak), key drivers for each force, overall industry attractiveness verdict, strategic implications
**Reasoning:** Most fundamental Porter framework, used 3+ times per strategic analysis, saves 30+ minutes of unstructured industry assessment, provides rigorous structure for what is often done ad hoc

---

### 2. value-chain-mapping

**Source Pattern:** Value Chain Analysis
**Purpose:** Disaggregate a company's activities to identify sources of competitive advantage and cost drivers
**Trigger:** "Map our value chain" or "Where does our competitive advantage come from?" or "Analyze our activities" or "Cost structure analysis"
**Inputs:** Company description, business model, key operations information
**Outputs:** Value chain map with primary and support activities, linkage identification, cost driver analysis, differentiation source analysis, comparison to competitors where relevant
**Reasoning:** Essential for understanding HOW a company competes, not just WHERE it positions, used in any competitive advantage analysis, reveals non-obvious sources of advantage through linkages

---

### 3. generic-strategy-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Generic Strategy Selection
**Purpose:** Determine a company's strategic position (cost leadership, differentiation, or focus) and identify "stuck in the middle" risks
**Trigger:** "What is our strategy?" or "Are we stuck in the middle?" or "Should we differentiate or compete on cost?" or "Strategic positioning analysis"
**Inputs:** Company description, competitive position, customer segments, cost structure, differentiation factors
**Outputs:** Current strategy classification, evidence assessment, trade-off analysis, "stuck in the middle" diagnosis, recommendations for strengthening position
**Reasoning:** Core strategic choice every company must make, frequently misunderstood, provides clear framework for avoiding the most common strategic error

---

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. strategic-position-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** Strategic Position Diagnosis (OE vs. Strategy distinction)
**Purpose:** Distinguish between operational effectiveness improvements and true strategic positioning to prevent strategic confusion
**Trigger:** "Is this strategic?" or "Are we just doing operational improvements?" or "What's the difference between strategy and operations?"
**Inputs:** Proposed initiative or current activities, competitive context
**Outputs:** Classification (operational effectiveness vs. strategic positioning), trade-off assessment, fit analysis, sustainability evaluation, recommendations
**Reasoning:** Common source of strategic confusion, prevents wasted effort on non-strategic initiatives, clarifies what truly constitutes competitive advantage

---

### 5. competitive-position-mapping

**Source Pattern:** Competitive Position Mapping / Strategic Groups
**Purpose:** Map the competitive landscape by identifying strategic groups and a company's position relative to competitors
**Trigger:** "Map our competitive position" or "Who are our real competitors?" or "Strategic group analysis" or "Competitive landscape mapping"
**Inputs:** Industry, key competitors, strategic dimensions to consider
**Outputs:** Strategic group map, mobility barriers analysis, competitive position assessment, implications for strategy
**Reasoning:** Clarifies competitive context, identifies true competitors vs. apparent competitors, reveals opportunities and threats based on position

---

### 6. shared-value-opportunity-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Creating Shared Value (CSV) Framework
**Purpose:** Identify opportunities to create economic value while simultaneously creating value for society
**Trigger:** "How can we create shared value?" or "Social impact that drives profit" or "CSV analysis" or "Business case for social impact"
**Inputs:** Company description, industry context, social/environmental challenges in operating environment
**Outputs:** Shared value opportunities across three levels (products/markets, value chain, clusters), prioritization based on business impact and social impact, implementation considerations
**Reasoning:** Links social purpose to competitive strategy, avoids CSR-as-cost thinking, increasingly relevant as stakeholder expectations evolve

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Diamond Model (National Competitive Advantage) | Geographic/national scope; less actionable for individual companies; primarily academic/policy framework |
| Cluster Theory | Reference knowledge about location economics; not a repeatable decision process for typical users |
| Historical Context / Evolution of Strategy | Pure reference information; no actionable workflow |
| Vocabulary Nuances | Reference material for consistency; integrated into other skills |
| Common Strategic Errors | Warning/gotcha content; stays as expertise reference |
| Integration Notes | Guidance for expert interaction; not standalone skill |
| Industry Examples | Reference examples; supports other skills but not standalone |
