## Notes

### Comprehensive Soldier Fitness Controversy
The expertise.md accurately documents the controversy surrounding the CSF program, including criticisms from researchers like George Bonanno and Seligman's acknowledgment of lacking objective behavioral measures. This is a nuanced topic where the expertise file presents both the program's claims and the scientific critiques, which is appropriate.

### Dating of Learned Optimism
Some sources list the publication date as 1990 (copyright) while others show 1991 (first edition publication). The expertise.md uses 1990, which is the copyright year and commonly cited date.

### Evolution of Seligman's Framework
The expertise.md correctly documents the evolution from the three types of happiness (Authentic Happiness, 2002) to the PERMA model (Flourish, 2011), noting that Seligman himself shifted his framework.
