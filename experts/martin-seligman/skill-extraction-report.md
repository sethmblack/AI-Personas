## HIGH Priority

### 1. perma-assessment

**Source Pattern:** PERMA Model of Well-Being
**Purpose:** Diagnose well-being across five dimensions (Positive emotion, Engagement, Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment) and identify pillars needing intervention
**Trigger:** "Assess team well-being," "Diagnose flourishing gaps," "PERMA audit," or when burnout, disengagement, or morale issues surface
**Inputs:** Context description (individual, team, organization), current challenges, observable symptoms
**Outputs:** PERMA scorecard with each pillar rated, intervention priorities, specific recommendations per weak pillar
**Reasoning:** Core Seligman framework with 5 distinct measurable dimensions. High frequency use (any well-being conversation), saves 30+ minutes of ad-hoc assessment, provides structured diagnostic that connects directly to interventions. The PERMA-Profiler research validates measurement approach.

---

### 2. explanatory-style-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Explanatory Styles (The Three P's)
**Purpose:** Analyze how someone explains negative events across three dimensions (Permanence, Pervasiveness, Personalization) to diagnose learned helplessness and guide reframing
**Trigger:** "Why do I keep failing?", "I always mess up," "Everything is broken," or when permanent-pervasive-personal language detected
**Inputs:** Narrative about a setback or failure, direct quotes from the person describing what happened
**Outputs:** Diagnosis of explanatory style (pessimistic vs optimistic), specific dimension scores, reframe suggestions for each pessimistic dimension
**Reasoning:** Foundational Seligman technique that predicts depression, resilience, and performance. Clear 3-dimension framework with diagnostic questions. High value because identifying explanatory style is prerequisite to ABCDE intervention. Well-researched predictive validity.

---

### 3. abcde-disputation

**Source Pattern:** The ABCDE Model for Cognitive Restructuring
**Purpose:** Guide someone through systematic cognitive restructuring to transform pessimistic beliefs about adversity into energizing, constructive responses
**Trigger:** "Help me process this failure," "I cannot stop thinking about what went wrong," "Reframe this setback," or after explanatory-style-analysis identifies pessimism
**Inputs:** Description of the adversity, the person's beliefs about it, observed consequences (feelings, behaviors)
**Outputs:** Completed ABCDE worksheet with disputation arguments, energization statement, action plan
**Reasoning:** Core therapeutic technique from Seligman's learned optimism work. 5-step structured process that produces documented cognitive shift. Research shows 32% depression reduction. Integrates naturally with explanatory-style-analysis as downstream intervention. High value for building team resilience.

---

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. strengths-deployment

**Source Pattern:** Signature Strengths Deployment + VIA Character Strengths Framework
**Purpose:** Identify signature character strengths and design daily practices to deploy them, increasing engagement and life satisfaction
**Trigger:** "What are my strengths?", "How can I find more engagement?", "I feel stuck in my role," or when designing roles/teams
**Inputs:** VIA survey results or self-described strengths, current role description, areas of disengagement
**Outputs:** Top 5 signature strengths identified, deployment opportunities mapped to daily activities, weekly practice plan
**Reasoning:** Research shows using strengths in new ways daily produces 6-month happiness boost. Medium priority because it requires VIA survey input (external dependency). Complements PERMA's Engagement pillar. Some overlap with existing character-assessment skill (35%) but distinct strengths-deployment action focus.

---

### 5. three-good-things-practice

**Source Pattern:** Three Good Things Exercise + Gratitude Visit
**Purpose:** Guide implementation of evidence-based gratitude practices that produce lasting increases in happiness and decreases in depression
**Trigger:** "Help me practice gratitude," "I want to be happier," "I focus too much on what goes wrong," or when PERMA assessment shows weak Positive Emotion
**Inputs:** Commitment level (daily practice duration), current mood state, willingness to do gratitude visit
**Outputs:** Personalized practice protocol, evening reflection prompts, progress tracking template, optional gratitude visit guidance
**Reasoning:** Most researched positive psychology intervention with 6-month effects from 1-week practice. Clear, simple protocol but nuanced implementation (frequency matters). Medium priority because it is a personal practice rather than team/system intervention, but high evidence base.

## LOW Priority

None identified - all candidates meeting criteria are HIGH or MEDIUM priority.

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| VIA Character Strengths Framework | Reference taxonomy (24 strengths, 6 virtues); no workflow beyond listing; subsumed by strengths-deployment |
| Biographical Context | Pure reference data (birth, education, positions); not actionable |
| Books and Key Works | Static reference list for citation; no execution steps |
| Integration Notes | Expert coordination guidance; context-dependent, not generalizable |
| Research Evidence Summaries | Data citations to reference in arguments; no standalone workflow |
| The Three Types of Happiness | Conceptual framework from Authentic Happiness; superseded by PERMA in Seligman's own work |
| Evolution from Happiness to Well-Being | Historical context; explains PERMA origin but is not itself actionable |
| MAPP Program Details | Institutional information; not a technique to apply |
| Tomorrowmind Summary | Book summary; insights folded into other patterns |
| Flow and Engagement Details | Conceptual explanation; incorporated into PERMA Engagement pillar |
