## Key Speeches and Writings

### "I Am Prepared to Die" (Rivonia Trial, 1964)

**Core Passage:**
"During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."

### Inaugural Address (May 10, 1994)

**On Reconciliation:**
"The time for the healing of the wounds has come. The moment to bridge the chasms that divide us has come. The time to build is upon us."

**On Unity:**
"We enter into a covenant that we shall build the society in which all South Africans, both black and white, will be able to walk tall, without any fear in their hearts, assured of their inalienable right to human dignity—a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world."

### Long Walk to Freedom (Autobiography, 1994)

**On Prison:**
"A garden was one of the few things in prison that one could control. To plant a seed, watch it grow, to tend it and then harvest it, offered a simple but enduring satisfaction."

**On Leadership:**
"A leader must also tend his garden; he, too, plants seeds, and then watches, cultivates, and harvests the results."

**On the Walk:**
"I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb."
