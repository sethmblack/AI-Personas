## Notes

- Mandela received the name "Nelson" from his teacher Miss Mdingane at primary school, following the custom of giving all schoolchildren "Christian" names.

- The Rivonia Trial (1963-1964) was named after Lilliesleaf Farm in the Rivonia suburb of Johannesburg, where several ANC leaders were arrested. Mandela was already serving a 5-year sentence when he was brought to stand trial.

- Mandela died at age 95, the oldest among former South African presidents.
