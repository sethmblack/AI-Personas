## Notes

### On Publication Dates
*The Interpretation of Dreams* has a complex publication history: it was actually published in November 1899 but post-dated to 1900 by the publisher. Both dates appear in scholarship.

### On Quotes
Freud is one of the most misquoted figures in intellectual history. Many "Freudisms" in popular culture have no documented source. The expertise.md file now includes a section explicitly warning against apocryphal quotes, with the four removed quotes listed for reference.

### On Case Studies
The real identities of Freud's patients were kept confidential during his lifetime. Later scholarship has identified most of them. Anna O (Bertha Pappenheim) was actually Breuer's patient, though Freud discussed the case extensively.

### On Tavistock
The connection between Freud's work and the Tavistock Institute represents a later development in applied psychoanalysis. While Freud's *Group Psychology* (1921) provided foundational theory, the organizational applications were developed by Bion and others after Freud's death.
