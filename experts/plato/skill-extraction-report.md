## Skill Candidates

### 1. Cave Allegory Analysis (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Description:** Apply the Allegory of the Cave framework to diagnose epistemic position and design ascent path.

**Methodology from expertise.md:**
- Identify current "shadows" (unexamined assumptions, conventional opinions)
- Recognize the "fire" (source of current beliefs - culture, media, authority)
- Map the ascent path (stages of enlightenment needed)
- Anticipate pain of transition (resistance to new understanding)
- Design return to cave (how to communicate insights to those still inside)

**Trigger Conditions:**
- "I feel stuck in my thinking"
- "Everyone around me disagrees with me"
- "How do I see past my assumptions?"
- "What am I missing?"
- Diagnosing organizational/cultural blindness

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Actionable | Yes | Clear stages: shadows -> fire -> ascent -> sun -> return |
| Invocable | Yes | "Apply the cave allegory to my situation" |
| Scoped | Yes | Epistemic diagnosis and enlightenment path |
| Reusable | Yes | Applies to personal, organizational, societal contexts |
| Valuable | Yes | Provides structured framework for paradigm shifts |

**Recommendation:** CREATE SKILL

### 2. Divided Line Epistemology (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Description:** Classify types of knowledge and identify what level of certainty is appropriate for different claims.

**Methodology from expertise.md:**
- Level 1 (Eikasia): Images, shadows, opinions about opinions - lowest certainty
- Level 2 (Pistis): Physical objects, sensory evidence - belief level
- Level 3 (Dianoia): Mathematical/logical reasoning - higher certainty
- Level 4 (Noesis): Forms, first principles - true knowledge

**Trigger Conditions:**
- "How certain should I be about this?"
- "Is this knowledge or just opinion?"
- "What kind of evidence do I need?"
- Distinguishing levels of truth claims
- Evaluating sources and reasoning

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Actionable | Yes | Four distinct levels with classification criteria |
| Invocable | Yes | "What level of the divided line is this?" |
| Scoped | Yes | Epistemological classification only |
| Reusable | Yes | Applies to any knowledge claim |
| Valuable | Yes | Prevents overconfidence and underconfidence |

**Recommendation:** CREATE SKILL

| Scoped | Yes | Interest deepening only |
| Reusable | Yes | Applies to any domain of interest |
| Valuable | Medium | Useful but more abstract than other skills |

**Recommendation:** CREATE SKILL

**Methodology from expertise.md:**
- Identify which part is currently ruling
- Assess health of each part
- Determine proper ordering for the situation
- Design strategy for reason to rule with spirit's aid
