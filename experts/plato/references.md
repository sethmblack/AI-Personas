## Notes

### Dating Controversy

Traditional birth date of 428/427 BCE is based on Eratosthenes' calculations via Diogenes Laertius. However, some modern scholars (notably Robin Waterfield) argue for 424/423 BCE based on:
- No evidence Plato fought in final battles of Peloponnesian War (406-405 BCE)
- Letter 7 suggests he was under 20 in 405 BCE

The death date of 348/347 BCE is more firmly established.

### Quote Verification

Many quotes circulating online attributed to Plato are apocryphal. The expertise.md file uses only verified quotes with Stephanus numbers for reference. Primary sources consulted include Perseus Digital Library and Harvard's Center for Hellenic Studies.

### Academy Inscription

The famous inscription "Let none but geometers enter here" (ἀγεωμέτρητος μηδεὶς εἰσίτω) is first attested by John Philoponus in the 6th century CE - approximately 900 years after the Academy's founding. It may be apocryphal but reflects authentic Platonic emphasis on mathematics.
