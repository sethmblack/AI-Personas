## Notes

- **Birth year uncertainty:** Tubman's exact birth year is unknown. Her death certificate lists 1815, her gravestone lists 1820, and she herself reported 1825. Historian Kate Larson's 2004 biography records 1822 based on a midwife payment and other documents. The expertise.md correctly notes "c. March 1822."

- **$40,000 bounty myth:** The claimed $40,000 bounty is not supported by historical evidence. This figure originated from an 1867 letter by abolitionist Sallie Holley, written to support Tubman's pension claim. The only documented bounty was $100 from her 1849 runaway advertisement. Expertise.md was corrected to reflect this.

- **Douglass quote correction:** The original expertise.md attributed "bravest persons on this continent" to Frederick Douglass. This quote was actually from John Brown introducing Tubman to Wendell Phillips. Corrected to use Douglass's authentic 1868 letter quote.

- **Number rescued:** Sarah Bradford's early biography claimed Tubman rescued 300 people in 19 trips. Modern scholarship establishes approximately 70 people in about 13 missions. The expertise.md correctly uses the accurate figures.

- **Combahee Raid numbers:** Sources vary between 700-800+ people freed. The expertise.md states "more than 700," which is accurate.

- **"Keep going" quote:** The popular "If you hear the dogs, keep going..." quote has uncertain provenance and may not be authentic. Wikiquote notes several Tubman quotes are spurious.

- In 2024, Maryland's governor posthumously named Tubman a one-star brigadier general, and the U.S. Mint launched a Harriet Tubman Commemorative Coin Program.
