## Historical Context

### Early Life and Escape
Born into slavery as Araminta Ross, Tubman endured brutal conditions including a severe head injury as a teenager when an overseer threw a heavy metal weight that struck her skull. This injury caused lifelong seizures and vivid dreams she interpreted as divine visions. In 1849, she escaped alone from Maryland to Philadelphia, traveling nearly 90 miles through hostile territory using the North Star as her guide.

### Underground Railroad Conductor (1850-1860)
After her own escape, Tubman returned to Maryland at least 13 times over the next decade, rescuing approximately 70 enslaved people including her parents, siblings, and other family members. She famously said: "I was the conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say - I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger."

### Civil War Service (1861-1865)
- Served as nurse, cook, and laundress for Union Army at Fort Monroe and later in South Carolina
- Became first American woman to lead an armed military assault
- Conducted intelligence operations behind Confederate lines
- Led the Combahee River Raid (June 1863), liberating more than 700 enslaved people

### Post-War Activism
- Active in women's suffrage movement
- Spoke at conventions alongside Susan B. Anthony and other suffragists
- Established Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged in Auburn, New York
- Continued advocacy for African American rights until her death

## Key Relationships and Network

- **William Still** - Philadelphia-based Underground Railroad coordinator who documented Tubman's missions
- **Thomas Garrett** - Wilmington, Delaware stationmaster who assisted in numerous rescues
- **John Brown** - Helped plan the Harper's Ferry raid; Brown called her "General Tubman"

### Military Connections
- **Colonel James Montgomery** - Commanded Black troops in South Carolina; led ground forces in Combahee Raid

- **Secretary of State William Seward** - Auburn neighbor who sold Tubman her home

## Famous Quotations

### On Freedom and Determination
> "There was one of two things I had a right to: liberty or death. If I could not have one, I would take the other, for no man should take me alive. I should fight for liberty as long as my strength lasted."

### On Perseverance
> "If you hear the dogs, keep going. If you see the torches in the woods, keep going. If there's shouting after you, keep going. Don't ever stop. Keep going. If you want a taste of freedom, keep going."

### On the Underground Railroad
> "I was the conductor of the Underground Railroad for eight years, and I can say what most conductors can't say - I never ran my train off the track and I never lost a passenger."

### On Faith and Divine Guidance
> "'Twant me, 'twas the Lord. I always told him, 'I trust to you. I don't know where to go or what to do, but I expect you to lead me,' and He always did."

### On Experiencing Freedom
> "When I found I had crossed that line, I looked at my hands to see if I was the same person. There was such a glory over everything; the sun came like gold through trees, and over the fields, and I felt like I was in Heaven."

### On Prayer and Strength
> "And I prayed to God to make me strong and able to fight, and that's what I've always prayed for ever since."

### On Her Upbringing
> "I grew up like a neglected weed - ignorant of liberty, having no experience of it."

## The Risk

Despite severe penalties for aiding runaways, Tubman was never caught during any of her rescue missions. The only documented bounty was $100 offered in her 1849 runaway advertisement. Although legend claims bounties totaling $40,000, no contemporaneous evidence for such rewards has been found—the figure originated from an 1867 letter written to support Tubman's pension claim.
