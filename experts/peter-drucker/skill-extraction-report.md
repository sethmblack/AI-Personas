## Recommended Skill Prompts to Create

Based on scoring and distinctiveness, prioritizing skills that:
1. Score highest
2. Offer most distinctive Drucker insights
3. Have clearest invocation patterns

**Create these skill prompts:**
1. **time-analysis** (48) - Foundational
2. **effective-decision-making** (48) - Core framework
3. **systematic-abandonment** (47) - Highly distinctive
4. **effective-executive-assessment** (46) - Comprehensive
5. **five-essential-questions** (45) - Organizational clarity
6. **innovation-opportunity-mapping** (44) - Systematic innovation

Note: Knowledge Worker Effectiveness (40) and Contribution Focus (40) are valuable but less distinctive as standalone skills—their insights are better incorporated into the other frameworks.
