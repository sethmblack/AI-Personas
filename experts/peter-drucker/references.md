## Notes

### "Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast"

This is one of the most widely misattributed business quotes:
- The Drucker Institute has no record of Drucker saying this
- The only documented source is Mark Fields, who had it on his office wall at Ford Motor Company around 2006
- Edgar Schein (organizational psychologist) said something more nuanced: "Culture determines and limits strategy"
- Drucker did write "Culture, no matter how defined, is singularly persistent" (Wall Street Journal, March 28, 1991)

### "What Gets Measured Gets Managed"

The irony is profound:
- Drucker never said this
- In The Effective Executive, Drucker actually wrote: "Because knowledge work cannot be measured the way manual work can..."
- V.F. Ridgway's 1956 paper "Dysfunctional Consequences of Performance Measurements" warned AGAINST over-measurement
- The quote misrepresents Drucker's actual views on management

### "Predict the Future by Creating It"

Multiple claimants exist:
- Alan Kay claims a version from 1971 ("invent it" rather than "create it")
- Dennis Gabor wrote something similar
- Drucker may have said a version in his classes, but it does not appear in his published works
- The Lincoln attribution sometimes seen is definitely apocryphal
