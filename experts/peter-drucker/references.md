## Quote Verification

### Removed (Apocryphal/Misattributed)

| Quote | Status | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| "Culture eats strategy for breakfast." | REMOVED | The Drucker Institute has no record of Drucker saying this. The only documented source is Mark Fields, who had it on his office wall at Ford Motor Company around 2006. Edgar Schein said something similar but more nuanced. Drucker wrote about culture but not this phrase. |
| "What gets measured gets managed." | REMOVED | The Drucker Institute confirms Drucker never said this. In The Effective Executive, Drucker actually wrote "Because knowledge work cannot be measured the way manual work can..." V.F. Ridgway's 1956 paper on dysfunctional consequences of performance measurement is closer to the source. The quote misrepresents Drucker's actual views. |
| "The best way to predict your future is to create it." | REMOVED | Cannot be found in Drucker's published works. Alan Kay claims a version ("invent it" rather than "create it") from 1971. Dennis Gabor wrote something similar. Drucker may have said a version in lectures, but it is not documented in his published works. The Lincoln attribution sometimes seen is definitely false. |

## Detailed Notes on Apocryphal Quotes

### "Culture Eats Strategy for Breakfast"

This is one of the most widely misattributed business quotes:

- The Drucker Institute has no record of Drucker saying this
- The only documented source is Mark Fields, who had it on his office wall at Ford Motor Company around 2006
- Edgar Schein (organizational psychologist) said something more nuanced: "Culture determines and limits strategy"
- Drucker did write "Culture, no matter how defined, is singularly persistent" (Wall Street Journal, March 28, 1991)
- The phrase has become ubiquitous in business writing, almost always attributed to Drucker without verification

**Action taken:** Removed from all expert files

### "What Gets Measured Gets Managed"

The irony of this quote is profound:

- Drucker never said this
- In The Effective Executive, Drucker actually wrote: "Because knowledge work cannot be measured the way manual work can..."
- V.F. Ridgway's 1956 paper "Dysfunctional Consequences of Performance Measurements" warned AGAINST over-measurement
- The quote misrepresents Drucker's actual views on management
- Drucker was nuanced about measurement, recognizing its limits, not evangelical about it
- The misattribution has spread so widely that it appears in most business books and articles about management

**Action taken:** Removed from all expert files

### "The Best Way to Predict Your Future Is to Create It"

Multiple claimants exist for this quote:

- Alan Kay claims a version from 1971 ("The best way to predict the future is to invent it")
- Dennis Gabor wrote something similar in his 1963 book "Inventing the Future"
- Drucker may have said a version in his classes or lectures, but it does not appear in his published works
- The Lincoln attribution sometimes seen is definitely apocryphal (Lincoln scholarship confirms this)
- Without a verifiable source, it cannot be reliably attributed to Drucker

**Action taken:** Removed from all expert files
