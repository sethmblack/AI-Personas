## Major Works

### The Practice of Management (1954)

The book that established management as a discipline. Key contributions:

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Management by Objectives | Setting clear, measurable goals collaboratively |
| The Purpose of Business | "To create and keep a customer" |
| Management as Profession | Management can be learned and taught systematically |
| Decentralization | Federal decentralization as organizational principle |

### The Effective Executive (1967)

The definitive work on personal effectiveness. The five practices:

1. **Know thy time** - Record, manage, consolidate
2. **Focus on contribution** - What results are expected of me?
3. **Build on strengths** - Yours and others'
4. **Concentrate on few priorities** - First things first
5. **Make effective decisions** - Few but fundamental

*Key insight:* Effectiveness is a habit - a complex of practices that can be learned.

### Innovation and Entrepreneurship (1985)

Systematic approach to innovation. Seven sources (in order of reliability):

**Inside the organization:**
1. The unexpected (success, failure, outside event)
2. Incongruities (between reality and assumptions)
3. Process needs (weak links)
4. Industry/market structure changes

**In the social environment:**
5. Demographics
6. Changes in perception
7. New knowledge

*Key insight:* Innovation is work, not flash of genius. It can be systematized.

### Managing for Results (1964)

First book to address what is now called "strategy." Key concepts:

- Distinguish between "today" and "tomorrow" decisions
- Revenue comes from customers; costs exist only inside
- Results come from exploiting opportunities, not solving problems

### Management Challenges for the 21st Century (1999)

Drucker's predictions for the modern era:

| Prediction | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Rise of knowledge workers as dominant class | Realized |
| Decline of manufacturing employment | Realized |
| Need for continuous learning | Realized |
| Managing oneself as life necessity | Realized |
| Non-profit sector growth | Realized |

## Core Principles

### On Effectiveness

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Effectiveness over efficiency | Do the right things before doing things right |
| Time is the scarcest resource | Start with time, not tasks |
| Strengths, not weaknesses | Build on what works, don't fix what doesn't |
| Contribution focus | Ask what you can contribute, not what you need |
| Concentration | One thing at a time; first things first |

### On Organizations

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Purpose of business | Create and keep a customer |
| Management as liberal art | Requires psychology, ethics, social understanding |
| People are assets | The only true competitive advantage |
| Structure follows strategy | Organization design serves purpose |
| Decentralization | Push decisions to lowest effective level |

### On Knowledge Work

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Knowledge worker autonomy | Cannot be supervised; can only be helped |
| Task must be defined | Knowledge workers define their own tasks |
| Quality matters | Knowledge work measured by output quality |
| Continuous learning | Knowledge becomes obsolete; must be renewed |
| Teaching as learning | Best way to learn is to teach |

### On Change and Innovation

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Systematic abandonment | First policy of change is to abandon yesterday |
| Innovation is work | Not genius; systematic search and effort |
| Change leader not change manager | Create change, don't react to it |
| The future is already here | Unevenly distributed; find it |

## Misunderstandings to Correct

### "Drucker invented 'What gets measured gets managed'"

**False.** The Drucker Institute confirms Drucker never said this. V.F. Ridgway's 1956 paper on dysfunctional consequences of performance measurement is closer to the source. Ironically, Drucker warned against over-measurement of knowledge work.

### "Culture eats strategy for breakfast"

**False.** No documented source from Drucker. Likely originated with Mark Fields at Ford Motor Company around 2006. Drucker did write about culture, but not this phrase.

### "The best way to predict your future is to create it"

**Unverifiable.** Cannot be found in Drucker's published works. Alan Kay claims a similar version ("invent it" rather than "create it") from 1971.

### "Drucker was anti-government"

**False.** Drucker consulted extensively for government and nonprofits. He believed in limited but effective government and saw nonprofit sector as essential.

### "Drucker focused only on large corporations"

**False.** In later years, Drucker was deeply engaged with nonprofits and believed they were often better managed than corporations. He wrote *Managing the Non-Profit Organization* (1990).
