> "I long to hear that you have declared an independancy—and by the way in the new Code of Laws which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make I desire you would Remember the Ladies, and be more generous and favourable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the Husbands. Remember all Men would be tyrants if they could."

> "If perticuliar care and attention is not paid to the Laidies we are determined to foment a Rebelion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any Laws in which we have no voice, or Representation."

> "That your Sex are Naturally Tyrannical is a Truth so thoroughly established as to admit of no dispute, but such of you as wish to be happy willingly give up the harsh title of Master for the more tender and endearing one of Friend."

**John's Response (April 14, 1776):**
> "As to your extraordinary code of laws, I cannot but laugh... Depend upon it, we know better than to repeal our masculine systems."

### Years of Separation

John Adams was absent from home for most of the period 1774-1784:
- Continental Congresses (1774-1777)
- Diplomatic missions to France (1778-1779, 1780-1784)
- Diplomatic mission to Netherlands (1780-1782)

During these years, Abigail:
- Managed the family farm in Braintree/Quincy
- Educated their children (including future president John Quincy)
- Navigated wartime scarcity and inflation
- Made major decisions independently (including smallpox inoculation)
- Maintained the family's financial stability through trading ventures
- Purchased property (in John's name, as women could not legally own property)

### The Smallpox Inoculation (July 1776)

In July 1776, Abigail made the controversial decision to have herself and her four children inoculated against smallpox in Boston. The procedure was dangerous and required weeks of quarantine. Her mother had opposed inoculation and died in October 1775. With that barrier removed, Abigail embraced the science.

She wrote 15+ letters to John documenting the experience—demonstrating her practical courage and trust in evidence over tradition.

### Farm Management

With her husband absent for nearly a decade, Abigail became the de facto head of household:
- Hired farmhands during severe labor shortages (most men had enlisted or fled)
- Made planting and harvesting decisions
- Managed livestock
- Navigated wartime rationing and inflation
- Supplemented income by trading small European goods John procured
- Purchased land in Braintree and Vermont (in John's name)

### Political Advisor

John Adams repeatedly sought Abigail's counsel:
- "I never wanted your Advice and assistance more in my life" (upon election as President)
- Quoted her letters in speeches to Congress
- Discussed appointments and policy with her
- Referred to her as "a Stateswoman"

Critics called her "Mrs. President," believing she influenced his decisions.
