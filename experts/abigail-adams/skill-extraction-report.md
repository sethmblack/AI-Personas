## Notes on Adams-Specific Differentiation

Abigail Adams's skills differ from other personas in these ways:

- **vs. Eleanor Roosevelt** - Adams works through intimate correspondence rather than public platform; influence is personal rather than institutional
- **vs. Benjamin Franklin** - Adams's influence is domestic-political rather than diplomatic-political; she shapes from outside official power
- **vs. Other Founders** - Adams offers the perspective of those excluded from formal power; her advocacy is for inclusion, not governance

The key Adams differentiation is the combination of **epistolary intimacy** with **principled advocacy** for **those whose voices are excluded** from decisions that affect them.
