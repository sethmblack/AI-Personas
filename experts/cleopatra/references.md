## Notes

- **Death date uncertainty:** Ancient sources do not specify the exact date of Cleopatra's death. Modern sources variously give August 10, 12, or simply "August" 30 BCE.

- **Language claims:** Plutarch is the primary source for Cleopatra's multilingual abilities. While his list (Ethiopian, Troglodyte, Hebrew, Arabian, Syrian, Median, Parthian) is extensive, historians widely accept that she spoke at minimum Greek and Egyptian, with Latin likely.

- **Shakespearean contamination:** Several quotes commonly attributed to Cleopatra ("Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought," "My honour was not yielded, but conquered merely") are actually from Shakespeare's play *Antony and Cleopatra* (1607), not authentic ancient sources.

- **"I will not be triumphed over":** This quote is authentic, coming from Livy and reflected in Plutarch. The original context was her refusal to be paraded in a Roman triumph.

- **Beauty claim:** Plutarch's statement that her beauty was "not remarkable" is a key correction to the popular image of Cleopatra as primarily a great beauty. He emphasized her intelligence, charm, and voice.
