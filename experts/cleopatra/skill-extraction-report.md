## HIGH Priority

### 1. strategic-entrance-design
**Score: 45/50**

**Source Pattern:** The Strategic Entrance / The Tarsos Meeting
**Purpose:** Design first impressions and initial presentations that establish favorable frames for relationships, negotiations, or new situations.
**Trigger:** "How should I make my entrance?" or "Design my first impression" or "How do I set the frame for this meeting?"
**Inputs:** Context of meeting/relationship, your assets and strengths, audience expectations, desired frame
**Outputs:** Strategic recommendation for timing, setting, presentation style, and opening moves; specific elements to include; frame to establish

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9/10 - Clear process (assess audience, identify assets, design presentation, choose setting, plan opening)
- Invocable: 9/10 - Natural triggers ("How do I make an impression?" "What's my entrance strategy?")
- Scoped: 9/10 - Focused on initial presentation and frame-setting
- Reusable: 9/10 - Job interviews, investor meetings, new teams, client presentations, negotiations
- Valuable: 9/10 - First impressions shape entire relationships; getting this right has outsized impact

**Reasoning:** Cleopatra's signature capability - the carpet at Caesar's feet, the golden barge at Tarsos. This transforms vague "make a good impression" advice into structured strategic thinking about how initial presentations shape subsequent dynamics.

### 2. mutual-benefit-negotiation
**Score: 44/50**

**Source Pattern:** Partnership Framing / The Mutual Benefit Frame
**Purpose:** Transform apparent dependency into partnership by identifying and presenting mutual benefits, even when negotiating from a weaker position.
**Trigger:** "How do I negotiate from a weak position?" or "Frame this as mutual benefit" or "I need something from someone more powerful"
**Inputs:** Your needs, your assets, counterparty's likely needs, power differential, relationship goals
**Outputs:** Reframed proposition emphasizing mutual benefit; identification of what you uniquely offer; specific language and positioning; partnership structure

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9/10 - Clear steps (identify your assets, map their needs, find intersection, design proposition, choose language)
- Invocable: 8/10 - Triggered by negotiation from weakness, seeking resources
- Scoped: 9/10 - Focused on transforming dependency into partnership
- Reusable: 9/10 - Fundraising, job negotiation, vendor relationships, political alliances, any asymmetric negotiation
- Valuable: 9/10 - Changes the fundamental dynamic of negotiations; creates lasting partnerships rather than extractive transactions

**Reasoning:** Core Cleopatra methodology - she never begged, she proposed partnerships. Caesar needed Egypt's resources as much as she needed his legions. This skill teaches how to find and present that mutuality even when power imbalance seems absolute.

### 3. adaptive-audience-presentation
**Score: 42/50**

**Source Pattern:** Adaptive Intelligence / Dual Cultural Identity / Language of Connection
**Purpose:** Tailor communication, presentation, and framing to specific audiences, speaking to each in their own "language" (cultural, professional, personal).
**Trigger:** "How do I present this to different audiences?" or "Adapt my message for this group" or "Speak their language"
**Inputs:** Core message or proposition, audience characteristics, cultural/professional context, relationship history, desired outcome
**Outputs:** Audience-specific presentation strategy; key adaptations in language, frame, and emphasis; what to highlight and what to downplay; cultural/contextual considerations

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 8/10 - Clear process (analyze audience, identify their values/language, adapt presentation, choose emphasis)
- Invocable: 8/10 - Triggered by multi-stakeholder communication, diverse audiences
- Scoped: 9/10 - Focused on audience adaptation
- Reusable: 9/10 - Board vs. team communication, technical vs. business audiences, cross-cultural negotiation
- Valuable: 8/10 - Prevents miscommunication, builds connection, increases persuasion effectiveness

**Reasoning:** Cleopatra spoke nine languages and presented as Greek to Greeks, Egyptian to Egyptians. This skill extracts her methodology for adapting communication to audience without losing authenticity or core message.

### 4. dignified-exit-strategy
**Score: 41/50**

**Source Pattern:** The Dignified Exit / Strategic Suicide / Agency in Defeat
**Purpose:** When facing defeat or the need to exit a situation, design an exit that preserves dignity, agency, and favorable legacy.
**Trigger:** "How do I leave this situation with dignity?" or "Design my exit strategy" or "I'm losing - how do I end this well?"
**Inputs:** Current situation, likely outcomes, what you want to preserve, audience for your exit, future implications
**Outputs:** Exit strategy preserving core values; specific actions and timing; communication around the exit; legacy considerations

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 8/10 - Clear process (assess situation, identify what to preserve, design exit, plan communication)
- Invocable: 8/10 - Triggered by defeat, resignation, ending relationships
- Scoped: 9/10 - Focused specifically on exit scenarios
- Reusable: 8/10 - Leaving jobs, ending partnerships, withdrawing from markets, relationship endings
- Valuable: 8/10 - Exits shape legacy; poor exits can undo years of good work

**Reasoning:** Cleopatra's final act - refusing to be triumphed over - exemplifies maintaining agency even in total defeat. This skill addresses the often-neglected question of how to lose well.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. legitimacy-construction
**Score: 38/50**

**Source Pattern:** The Divine Mantle / The Isis Strategy / Dual Cultural Identity
**Purpose:** Build legitimacy and authority beyond formal credentials by associating with larger forces, traditions, or narratives.
**Trigger:** "How do I establish legitimacy?" or "Build my authority" or "I need to seem more credible"
**Inputs:** Your current position, sources of potential legitimacy, audience values, traditions or forces you can invoke
**Outputs:** Legitimacy strategy; specific associations to cultivate; symbolic elements to incorporate; narrative to construct

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 7/10 - Process exists but requires more abstract thinking about legitimacy sources
- Invocable: 7/10 - Triggered but less common than other scenarios
- Scoped: 8/10 - Focused on legitimacy construction
- Reusable: 8/10 - New leadership roles, entering new fields, building personal brand
- Valuable: 8/10 - Legitimacy enables action; without it, even good ideas fail

**Reasoning:** Cleopatra clothed herself in Isis mythology to transcend her Greek foreignness. The skill is valuable but more abstract than other Cleopatra patterns, making it harder to invoke and execute.

---

### 6. strategic-relationship-design
**Score: 36/50**

**Source Pattern:** Strategic Alliances / Partnership Design
**Purpose:** Design relationships that serve strategic purposes while building genuine connection - treating relationships as both personal and political.
**Trigger:** "How should I structure this relationship?" or "Design a strategic alliance" or "Make this relationship serve my goals"
**Inputs:** Relationship opportunity, your strategic needs, their likely needs, duration expectations, risk factors
**Outputs:** Relationship design including mutual benefits, boundaries, progression path, and exit considerations

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 7/10 - Process exists but relationship design is inherently less structured
- Invocable: 7/10 - Triggered by partnership opportunities, key relationships
- Scoped: 7/10 - Broader scope covering relationship lifecycle
- Reusable: 7/10 - Business partnerships, mentorships, political alliances, key stakeholder relationships
- Valuable: 8/10 - Key relationships often determine success; designing them well matters

**Reasoning:** Cleopatra's relationships with Caesar and Antony were masterclasses in strategic relationship management. However, the skill is broader and less structured than other patterns, making it harder to extract as a discrete workflow.
