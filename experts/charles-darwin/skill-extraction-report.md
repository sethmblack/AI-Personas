## HIGH Priority (40+ points)

### 1. variation-mapping

**Source Pattern:** Variation-focused observation; "These individual differences are highly important"
**Purpose:** Systematically identify and catalog the variations within any population, system, or category—the raw material for selection and optimization.
**Trigger:** "Map the variations" or "What varies here?" or "Show me the differences"
**Inputs:** Population, system, or category to analyze; criteria of interest
**Outputs:** Structured inventory of variations, dimensions of difference, distribution patterns, implications for selection

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear process: define population, identify dimensions, catalog variations, analyze distribution |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers: "What varies?", "Map the variations", "What are the differences?" |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: identifying and cataloging variation |
| Reusable | 10 | Universal—applies to products, people, organizations, markets, species, ideas |
| Valuable | 9 | Reveals what selection can act on; foundation for all optimization |

**Total: 46/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 2. selection-pressure-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Natural selection mechanism; "What determines which variants survive?"
**Purpose:** Identify the forces that determine which variants in a system survive, spread, and reproduce while others fail.
**Trigger:** "What's selecting here?" or "Analyze the selection pressures" or "Why do some succeed and others fail?"
**Inputs:** System or population under analysis; observable outcomes (what survives, what fails)
**Outputs:** Identified selection pressures, fitness criteria, prediction of what will be selected for/against

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear framework: identify outcomes, trace causal pressures, define fitness criteria |
| Invocable | 9 | Clear triggers: "What's selecting?", "Why does X win?", "What determines success?" |
| Scoped | 9 | Focused on identification of selective forces |
| Reusable | 10 | Markets, organizations, ideas, products, behaviors—any competitive system |
| Valuable | 10 | Core strategic insight—understanding what drives success/failure |

**Total: 47/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 3. patient-accumulation-method

**Source Pattern:** "Patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts"
**Purpose:** Gather comprehensive evidence from diverse sources before drawing conclusions—Darwin's core epistemic method.
**Trigger:** "Let me think through this carefully" or "Build the evidence base" or "What does the full picture show?"
**Inputs:** Question or hypothesis to investigate; available evidence sources
**Outputs:** Structured evidence inventory, pattern identification, confidence-weighted conclusions

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Structured process: define question, identify sources, gather evidence, pattern-find, conclude |

| Reusable | 9 | Research, strategy, decision-making, diagnosis—any complex judgment |
| Valuable | 9 | Prevents premature conclusions; produces more robust understanding |

**Total: 42/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 4. analogical-bridge

**Source Pattern:** Darwin's use of artificial selection to explain natural selection
**Purpose:** Use a familiar, observable process to explain and build acceptance for an unfamiliar or counterintuitive one.
**Trigger:** "Help me explain this" or "What's this like?" or "Build an analogy"
**Inputs:** Complex or unfamiliar concept to explain; audience knowledge base
**Outputs:** Source analogy selection, mapping of correspondences, limitations acknowledgment, persuasive framing

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear steps: identify target, find familiar source, map correspondences, note limits |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers: "What's this like?", "Help me explain", "Build an analogy" |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused on analogical explanation construction |
| Reusable | 10 | Teaching, persuasion, communication, understanding—universal |
| Valuable | 9 | Darwin's key persuasive technique; makes complex ideas accessible |

**Total: 45/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

---

### 5. severe-test-protocol

**Source Pattern:** "If it could be demonstrated... my theory would absolutely break down"
**Purpose:** Subject hypotheses, strategies, or beliefs to their strongest possible objections to test validity.
**Trigger:** "Test this against the hardest case" or "What would disprove this?" or "Steelman the objection"
**Inputs:** Hypothesis, strategy, or belief to test; domain context
**Outputs:** Identified vulnerabilities, hardest objections, test results, modified understanding

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear process: state hypothesis, identify potential disproofs, seek evidence, evaluate |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers: "What would break this?", "Severe test", "Hardest objection" |
| Scoped | 9 | Focused on rigorous hypothesis/strategy testing |
| Reusable | 10 | Science, business strategy, personal beliefs, decisions—universal |
| Valuable | 10 | Prevents confirmation bias; finds weaknesses before they matter |

**Total: 47/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

## MEDIUM Priority (30-39 points)

### 6. deep-time-extrapolation

**Source Pattern:** "What limit can be put to this power, acting during long ages?"
**Purpose:** Project small, observable changes across extended timescales to reveal their cumulative transformative power.
**Trigger:** "What happens over time?" or "Think long-term" or "How does this compound?"
**Inputs:** Small change or trend; relevant timescale; compounding mechanism
**Outputs:** Long-term projection, compounding analysis, transformation mapping

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Process exists but more conceptual—extend timescale, project effects |
