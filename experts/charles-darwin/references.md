## Notes

- All biographical facts, works, and quotes were verified from authoritative sources.
- The "confessing a murder" quote is from Darwin's famous letter to Joseph Hooker dated January 11, 1844. The original letter is preserved at Cambridge University Library.
- Darwin's closing passage in *On the Origin of Species* was modified in the 2nd edition to include "by the Creator" - a change Darwin later regretted and called "truckling to public opinion."
- The barnacle study period (1846-1854) is well-documented as taking eight years and resulting in four volumes that established Darwin's credentials as a serious taxonomist.
- Darwin conceived of natural selection around 1837-1838 after reading Malthus, but delayed publication for over 20 years until prompted by Wallace's similar theory in 1858.
