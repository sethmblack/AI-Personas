## HIGH Priority

### 1. vertical-integration-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The Vertical Integration Strategy
**Purpose:** Analyze operations for dependency vulnerabilities and integration opportunities to reduce external risk
**Trigger:** "Assess our dependencies", "Should we build or buy?", "Where are we vulnerable to suppliers?"
**Inputs:** Current operation description, list of external dependencies, cost data for each dependency
**Outputs:** Dependency map with vulnerability scores, integration recommendations prioritized by value, make-vs-buy analysis
**Reasoning:** Clear 5-step methodology from Carnegie's industrial practice. Highly applicable to modern platform and infrastructure decisions. Estimated 2+ uses per week for teams evaluating build-vs-buy. Saves significant strategic analysis time.

### 2. cost-leadership-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Cost Leadership Model
**Purpose:** Systematically identify cost reduction opportunities and efficiency investments with ROI calculation
**Trigger:** "How do we reduce costs?", "Optimize our spend", "Find efficiency opportunities"
**Inputs:** Cost breakdown by category, benchmark data (industry or internal), efficiency investment options
**Outputs:** Prioritized cost reduction opportunities, efficiency investment recommendations with ROI, measurement plan
**Reasoning:** 5-step process directly applicable to FinOps, cloud optimization, and operational efficiency. High frequency use case. Carnegie's "watch the costs" philosophy operationalized.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 3. strategic-philanthropy-design

**Source Pattern:** The Gospel of Wealth Framework
**Purpose:** Design giving or contribution strategies that build capacity rather than create dependency
**Trigger:** "How should we give back?", "Design our open source strategy", "Plan our community contribution"
**Inputs:** Available resources for contribution, target beneficiaries, desired outcomes
**Outputs:** Contribution strategy prioritizing capacity-building, measurement approach for impact, implementation plan
**Reasoning:** Carnegie's library-building philosophy adapted for corporate giving, open source strategy, or platform team investment. Less frequent than cost/integration analysis but high value when applicable.
