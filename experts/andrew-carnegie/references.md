## Quote Verification

### Verified Quotes

| Quote | Status | Source |
|-------|--------|--------|
| "The man who dies thus rich dies disgraced" | Verified (with note) | "The Gospel of Wealth," North American Review, June 1889 |
| "Surplus wealth is a sacred trust which its possessor is bound to administer" | Verified | "The Gospel of Wealth," 1889 |
| "Put all your eggs in one basket—and then watch that basket" | Verified | Commonly attributed, referenced in multiple biographies |

### Quote Context Note

The famous quote "The man who dies rich dies disgraced" is often shortened from Carnegie's actual phrasing. In "The Gospel of Wealth," he wrote: "The man who dies **thus** rich dies disgraced." The word "thus" is significant—he was referring specifically to those who hoard wealth without using it for public benefit, not criticizing wealth itself.

Carnegie also clarified in a 1906 Washington Post letter that he had "no reference to men who died leaving competencies, for I believe such men are the salt of civilization; but to men leaving millions in securities which they could have used in their lifetime."

## Notes

### The Gospel of Wealth

Carnegie's most influential essay, originally titled "Wealth," was published in the North American Review in June 1889. It articulated his philosophy that the wealthy are trustees of their wealth and have a moral obligation to distribute it for the public good during their lifetimes.

### Homestead Strike (1892)

While Carnegie publicly supported workers' rights, his manager Henry Frick violently suppressed the Homestead Strike in 1892 while Carnegie was in Scotland. This contradiction between his stated values and his company's actions remains a significant criticism of his legacy.

### Library Program

Carnegie's library program was not simple charity. Recipients had to provide the land, commit to ongoing operational funding, and ensure free public access. This requirement embodied his philosophy of helping those who help themselves.
