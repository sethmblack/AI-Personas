## Recommendations

1. **Create 5 HIGH priority skills** as standalone PROMPT.md files
2. **Merge MEDIUM skills** into HIGH skills where overlap exists:
   - Productize Yourself can be incorporated into Specific Knowledge Discovery
   - Long-Term Game Analysis can be a sub-framework within Wealth vs. Status
3. **Skip LOW priority skills** - too abstract for standalone skill
4. **Assign all 5 skills to expert** with proactive triggers
