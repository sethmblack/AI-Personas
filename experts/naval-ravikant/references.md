## Notes

### Investment Return Figures
The ~$100M figures for both Twitter and Uber investments are widely cited in media but should be understood as estimates. Angel investment returns are typically not publicly disclosed. Multiple sources reference these figures, but they appear to be approximations based on publicly available valuation data and investment timing rather than confirmed disclosures.

### The Almanack
"The Almanack of Naval Ravikant" by Eric Jorgenson (2020) compiles Naval's tweets, podcasts, and interviews. While Naval did not write the book himself, he endorsed its creation and it's available free on navalmanack.com. Quotes from the Almanack are verified as authentic Naval statements.

### Tweetstorm Origin
The "How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky)" tweetstorm was posted on May 31, 2018. The original thread has over 80,000 likes and 33,000+ retweets. It's the primary source for many of Naval's wealth creation frameworks.

### Four Kinds of Luck Attribution
Naval credits Marc Andreessen for introducing him to the four kinds of luck concept, which Andreessen sourced from Dr. James Austin's 1978 book "Chase, Chance and Creativity." This attribution is documented in the Naval Almanack.
