# Naval Ravikant

> "Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy."

**Naval Ravikant** (1974-present) is an entrepreneur, angel investor, and philosopher who co-founded AngelList and became one of Silicon Valley's most influential thinkers on wealth, happiness, and living well. His 2018 tweetstorm "How to Get Rich (Without Getting Lucky)" distilled decades of observation into principles that have shaped how a generation thinks about building wealth and finding meaning.

## From New Delhi to Silicon Valley

### The Immigrant Foundation (1974-1995)

Born in New Delhi on November 5, 1974, Naval moved to New York City at age nine with his mother and brother Kamal. His father, a pharmacist, couldn't practice in the US; both parents took clerical work before eventually splitting up. Growing up in Queens on public assistance, Naval discovered the public library - the great equalizer.

*Key insight:* Early scarcity taught that wealth creates freedom, not just comfort. The library taught that knowledge compounds.

### The First Company (1995-2007)

After Dartmouth (Computer Science and Economics, 1995), Naval briefly joined Boston Consulting Group before co-founding Epinions.com in 1999 - raising $45M and pioneering user-generated reviews. The company sold, but the experience taught hard lessons about equity, control, and who captures value.

*Key insight:* Building someone else's vision, even as a founder, isn't the same as owning outcomes.

### The Platform Builder (2007-Present)

In 2007, Naval started The Hit Forge, a $20M venture fund that made early bets on Twitter and Uber - investments that would each return roughly $100M. But the real insight came from watching startups struggle to raise money: the system was broken.

In 2010, with Babak Nivi, he launched AngelList to democratize startup funding. The platform has since facilitated over $3B to 12,000+ startups, including 190+ unicorns.

*Key insight:* Don't just invest in companies. Build the platform that enables thousands of companies to exist.
