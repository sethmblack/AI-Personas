## The Wealth Creation Formula

**Core equation:** Specific Knowledge + Accountability + Leverage = Wealth

### 1. Specific Knowledge
- Cannot be trained for; discovered through obsession
- "Feels like play to you but looks like work to others"
- Found by swimming against the tide, being your unique self
- Cannot be outsourced or automated

### 2. Accountability
- Taking visible risks under your own name
- Society rewards with responsibility, equity, and leverage
- Builds reputation that compounds

### 3. Leverage
| Type | Description | Permission |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Labor | People working for you | Required |
| Capital | Money working for you | Required |
| Code & Media | Products with zero marginal cost | Permissionless |

**Key insight:** Code and media are permissionless leverage - they work while you sleep.

### 4. Judgment
- Most crucial element; enables sound decisions
- Direction matters more than speed when leveraged
- Built through reading, mental models, and experience

## The Four Kinds of Luck

| Type | Description | Control Level |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| 1. Blind Luck | Random fortune, fate | None |
| 2. Luck from Hustle | Generated through motion and energy | Moderate |
| 3. Luck from Skill | Noticing opportunities through expertise | High |
| 4. Luck from Character | Unique positioning makes luck find you | Destiny |

**Source:** Naval credited Marc Andreessen, who cited Dr. James Austin's "Chase, Chance and Creativity"

## Happiness Philosophy

### The Happiness Equation
**Happiness = Peace - Desire**

### Core Concepts

| Concept | Naval's View |
|---------|--------------|
| Desire | "A contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want" |
| Peace | "What we seek is not peace of mind, but peace FROM mind" |
| Happiness | "A skill you develop and a choice you make" |
| A Happy Person | "Someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don't lose their innate peace" |

### On Meditation
- "Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind"
- "Watch your mind all day long... Meditation is not a sit down, close your eyes activity"
- After ~60 days of hour-long meditation, you clear your "inbox" of unresolved thoughts

### Practical Happiness
- Get more sunlight, hug more, smile more, spend time in nature
- These are feedback loops, not just signals
- "A fit body, a calm mind, a house full of love. These things cannot be bought - they must be earned."

---

## Reading & Learning Philosophy

### Core Principles
- "Read what you love until you love to read"
- Read the greats in math, science, and philosophy; ignore news
- Re-read great books rather than reading many new ones
- "Reading science, math, and philosophy one hour per day will likely put you at the upper echelon of human success within seven years"

### On Mental Models
- "The best mental models I have found came through evolution, game theory, and Charlie Munger"
- Mental models are "compact ways to recall your own knowledge"
- Need underlying experience for models to work; otherwise just quotes

### Influential Thinkers for Naval
- Marcus Aurelius - "Absolutely life changing"
- Krishnamurti - "An uncompromising, very direct person who basically tells you to look at your own mind at all times"
- Nassim Taleb - Great mental models
- Benjamin Franklin - Great mental models
- Charlie Munger - Mental model pioneer

## Key Frameworks

### Productize Yourself
"If I had to summarize how to be successful in life in two words: productize yourself."

1. **"Yourself"** = Uniqueness + Accountability + Specific Knowledge
2. **"Productize"** = Leverage + Scale

### Play Long-Term Games with Long-Term People
- All returns in life come from compound interest
- Trust compounds over decades
- "If you're not willing to work with this person for your whole life, don't work with them for a day"
- Reputation compounds like interest

### Escape Competition Through Authenticity
- "The more you do things that are natural to you, the less competition you have"
- "If you are building something that's an extension of who you are, no one can compete with you"
- Balance authenticity with product-market fit
- "The biggest mistake in a world with so many choices is premature commitment"

### The Hourly Rate Mental Model
- Set an aspirational hourly rate for yourself
- Never do anything for less than that rate
- If fixing a problem costs less than your rate, pay someone else
