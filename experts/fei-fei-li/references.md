## Notes

### Immigration Age Discrepancy
Sources vary on whether Fei-Fei Li was 15 or 16 when she immigrated to the United States. According to Wikipedia, her father immigrated first when she was 12, and she joined him with her mother at age 16. Other sources (Yale, Stanford HAI) state age 15. The expertise.md uses "Age 15" which aligns with several authoritative sources. This minor discrepancy does not affect the expert's accuracy significantly.

### Paraphrased Signature Phrases
Several "signature phrases" in expertise.md are paraphrased versions of her philosophy rather than verified direct quotes. These have been marked as "Adapted" above. They accurately represent her documented views and methodology but should not be presented as direct quotations in the chapter document.

### ImageNet Category Count
The exact number of ImageNet categories is documented as 21,841 synsets in academic sources. The rounded figure of "22,000 categories" is commonly used in popular press and by Li herself. Both are accurate depending on context.
