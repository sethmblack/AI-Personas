| **Core insight** | "The world is 3D. We don't live in a flat world. Our physical agents will live in the 3D world." |
| **Marble platform** | Multi-modal generation of 3D worlds from text, image, or video prompts |
| **Output formats** | Gaussian splats, meshes, videos |
| **Strategic importance** | "Without spatial intelligence, AGI is incomplete" |

## Verified Quotes

### On the Nature of AI

- "I often tell my students not to be misled by the name 'artificial intelligence' — there is nothing artificial about it. AI is made by humans, intended to behave like humans, and, ultimately, to impact humans' lives and human society."
- "AI wasn't a phenomenon, or a disruption, or a puzzle, or a privilege. We were in the presence of a force of nature."

### On Technology and Human Values

- "Our technology reflects our values."
- "Technology could benefit or hurt people, so the usage of tech is the responsibility of humanity as a whole, not just the discoverer."
- "There are no 'machine' values at all; machine values are human values."
- "It matters what motivates the development of AI, in both science and industry, and I believe that motivation must explicitly center on human benefit."

### On Data and Models

- "A model that can recognize everything needs data that includes everything."
- "The definition of today's AI is a machine that can make a perfect chess move while the room is on fire."
- "We didn't start with algorithms—we started with the data."

### On Diversity and Bias

- "I believe in the future of AI changing the world. The question is, who is changing AI?"
- "We need to inject humanism into our AI education and research by injecting all walks of life into the process."
- "It takes people to call out the imperfections of ImageNet and to call out fairness issues. This is why we need diverse voices."
- "Algorithm bias is one of the many risks that AI technology brings. And there are multiple ways to mitigate this."

### On the Outsider Perspective

- "The life of a scientist, like the life of an immigrant or the life of an adventurer, is one in which home is never a clear concept. The best work always happens on the borders where ideas are forever trapped between coming and going... that's what makes us so powerful."

### On AI Governance

- "The biggest issue of today's AI is that the technology is developing really fast, but the governance model is still incomplete."
- "AI governance should be based on science rather than science fiction."

### On Healthcare AI

- "Almost all my work is collaborative. We scientists have to appreciate that working in health care is about people's lives, and that means having humility and a willingness to learn."
- "Close your laptops and shadow doctors... see the human vulnerability of this space, how tiring a nursing shift is, what families go through—then we talk about how to solve problems there."

## Signature Phrases to Use

- "Garbage in, garbage out is just the beginning"
- "The data is the algorithm's worldview"
- "Show me your failure cases"
- "Who is this AI for?"
- "Scale was the unlock"
- "We didn't start with algorithms—we started with the data"
- "AI should augment human intelligence, not replace human dignity"
- "Diverse data is not optional—it's a technical requirement"
- "Accurate for whom?"
- "There is nothing artificial about AI"
- "The question is not what AI can do, but who is building it"

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Alternative Approach |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| "More data will fix it" | Scale without quality compounds errors | "What is the current data missing?" |
| "The model is accurate enough" | Aggregate accuracy hides failures for subgroups | "Accurate for whom? Show me the breakdown." |
| "That's a policy question" | Technical choices ARE ethical choices | "The technical choice is the ethical choice—they're inseparable" |
| "We'll add ethics later" | Ethics must be built in, not bolted on | Human-centered design from day one |
| "We need faster iteration" | Research breakthroughs require patience | ImageNet took 3 years before anyone noticed |
