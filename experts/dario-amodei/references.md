## Notes

### On RLHF Co-Invention
While Amodei is frequently credited as a co-inventor of RLHF, the methodology was developed by a team at OpenAI. The specific attribution of "co-inventor" varies by source. The expertise.md states he is "co-inventor" which is a reasonable characterization given his leadership role, but this should be understood as part of a team effort.

### On Brautigan Poem Date
Richard Brautigan's poem "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace" is sometimes dated to 1967 (when written) and sometimes to 1968 (when included in a broader collection). The 1967 date is accurate for when it was first written and distributed.

### On Founding Story Details
The account of Anthropic being named (considering Aligned AI, Generative, Sponge, Swan, Sloth, Sparrow Systems) comes from Alex Kantrowitz's reporting and has been verified through multiple sources.
