## HIGH Priority

### 1. antifragility-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Fragile-Robust-Antifragile Triad / Fragility Diagnosis
**Purpose:** Assess any system, decision, career, or investment across the fragility spectrum and prescribe structural changes to move toward antifragility.
**Trigger:** "How fragile is this?" or "Analyze the fragility" or "Is this antifragile?"
**Inputs:** Description of system, decision, business, or life situation; stress factors it might face
**Outputs:** Classification (fragile/robust/antifragile), specific fragilities identified, prescription for reducing fragility or achieving antifragility, warning signs to monitor
**Reasoning:** This is Taleb's core contribution to intellectual history. The triad is immediately applicable to business, career, health, and systems design. Clear diagnostic criteria with actionable output.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear 3-category classification with specific prescriptions |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural trigger phrases; distinctive Taleb terminology |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: fragility assessment |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to businesses, careers, health, relationships, systems |
| Valuable | 10 | Transforms how people think about risk and resilience |
| **Total** | **48** | **HIGH** |

### 2. barbell-strategy

**Source Pattern:** The Barbell Strategy
**Purpose:** Structure any risk/resource allocation as bimodal: extreme safety on one end, extreme speculation on the other, nothing in the middle.
**Trigger:** "Apply the barbell" or "How should I structure risk here?" or "Barbell this decision"
**Inputs:** Resources to allocate (money, time, career, attention), constraints, goals
**Outputs:** Specific barbell structure (safe component + speculative component), percentage allocation, what to explicitly avoid (the dangerous middle), implementation steps
**Reasoning:** One of Taleb's most immediately actionable frameworks. Applicable to investing, career planning, time management, and learning. Clear structure with specific allocation guidance.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Explicit allocation percentages and structure |
| Invocable | 10 | Distinctive trigger; "barbell" is memorable and unique |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: bimodal resource allocation |
| Reusable | 10 | Finance, career, time, learning, relationships |
| Valuable | 9 | Prevents common error of "medium risk" exposure |
| **Total** | **48** | **HIGH** |

### 3. skin-in-the-game-audit

**Source Pattern:** Skin in the Game / Agency Problem Analysis
**Purpose:** Evaluate any advice, system, or relationship by assessing who bears the consequences of decisions and identifying dangerous asymmetries.
**Trigger:** "Who has skin in the game?" or "Audit the incentives" or "Is this person exposed to downside?"
**Inputs:** Advice being given, decision-maker, affected parties, incentive structures
**Outputs:** Skin-in-the-game matrix (who decides vs. who bears consequences), identified asymmetries, trust/distrust recommendations, structural fixes
**Reasoning:** Critical for evaluating advice, partners, consultants, and institutions. Clear diagnostic framework. Immediately applicable to hiring, partnerships, and policy evaluation.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear matrix analysis with specific recommendations |
| Invocable | 10 | "Skin in the game" is highly distinctive |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: incentive/consequence alignment |
| Reusable | 10 | Business, politics, personal relationships, hiring |
| Valuable | 10 | Prevents being harmed by misaligned advisors |
| **Total** | **48** | **HIGH** |

---

### 4. via-negativa-reduction

**Source Pattern:** Via Negativa Principle
**Purpose:** Identify what to remove, avoid, or stop doing before adding anything new. Subtraction over addition.
**Trigger:** "What should I stop doing?" or "Apply via negativa" or "What should I remove?"
**Inputs:** Current state (habits, processes, systems, strategies), goals, problems
**Outputs:** List of things to remove/avoid, prioritized by harm reduction, warnings about iatrogenics (intervention harm), only then—if necessary—additions
**Reasoning:** Counterintuitive but highly valuable. Most people ask "what should I do?" when "what should I stop?" is more powerful. Prevents naive interventionism.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear subtraction-first methodology |
| Invocable | 8 | "Via negativa" requires familiarity; alternatives exist |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: identify removals |
| Reusable | 10 | Health, business, writing, life optimization |
| Valuable | 9 | Prevents common error of adding when subtracting is needed |
| **Total** | **45** | **HIGH** |

### 5. lindy-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Lindy Effect
**Purpose:** Evaluate ideas, technologies, practices, or investments based on their survival time to predict future robustness.
**Trigger:** "What does Lindy say?" or "Has this survived the test of time?" or "Apply the Lindy effect"
**Inputs:** Item to evaluate (book, technology, practice, institution), its age, competing alternatives
**Outputs:** Lindy score (age-based life expectancy), comparison with alternatives, recommendation on trust/adoption, caveats about when Lindy doesn't apply
**Reasoning:** Simple but powerful heuristic for decision-making. Immediately applicable to learning, technology choices, and investment. Clear rule with explicit exceptions.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Clear age-based heuristic with specific application |
| Invocable | 9 | "Lindy" is distinctive; natural trigger phrases |
| Scoped | 9 | Single responsibility: time-tested robustness assessment |
| Reusable | 9 | Books, technologies, practices, institutions |
| Valuable | 8 | Provides decision rule in uncertain domains |
| **Total** | **43** | **HIGH** |

---

## MEDIUM Priority

### 6. domain-classification

**Source Pattern:** Mediocristan vs. Extremistan
**Purpose:** Classify a domain as thin-tailed (Mediocristan) or fat-tailed (Extremistan) to determine appropriate reasoning and risk approaches.
**Trigger:** "Is this Mediocristan or Extremistan?" or "What kind of domain is this?"
**Inputs:** Domain or decision context, historical data patterns, potential for outlier events
**Outputs:** Domain classification, implications for prediction, appropriate risk strategy, common mistakes to avoid in that domain
**Reasoning:** Foundational Taleb concept but somewhat abstract. More of a precondition for other analyses than a standalone workflow. Important but less frequently invoked directly.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Classification leads to strategy, but indirect |
| Invocable | 8 | Distinctive terminology but requires context |
| Scoped | 8 | Single responsibility, but often a preliminary step |
| Reusable | 8 | Applicable to many domains but foundational rather than terminal |
| Valuable | 8 | Important but often implicit in other analyses |
| **Total** | **39** | **MEDIUM** |

---

### 7. optionality-design

**Source Pattern:** Optionality and Convexity
**Purpose:** Structure decisions and investments to maximize optionality—limited downside with unlimited upside.
**Trigger:** "How do I maximize optionality?" or "Design for convexity"
**Inputs:** Decision or investment, constraints, potential outcomes
**Outputs:** Options identified, downside limitation strategies, upside preservation tactics, comparison with non-optional alternatives
**Reasoning:** Important Taleb concept but overlaps significantly with barbell-strategy. More technical and abstract. Useful but less distinctive as a standalone skill.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Somewhat abstract; overlaps with barbell |
| Invocable | 7 | "Optionality" is known but not as punchy |
| Scoped | 7 | Overlaps with barbell-strategy |
| Reusable | 8 | Investing, career, decisions |
| Valuable | 8 | Important but partially captured by barbell |
| **Total** | **37** | **MEDIUM** |
