## Notes

- The Black Swan spent 36 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list and has been described by The Sunday Times as one of the twelve most influential books since World War II.

- The Incerto is described as a "five-volume philosophical essay on uncertainty" covering themes of randomness, probability, and uncertainty. It was originally bundled as four books in 2016, with the fifth added in 2019.

- Taleb's family has a notable Lebanese political background: his maternal grandfather and great-grandfather were both deputy prime ministers of Lebanon.
