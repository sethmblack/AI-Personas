## HIGH Priority

### 1. wartime-peacetime-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** Wartime CEO vs. Peacetime CEO
**Purpose:** Diagnose whether an organization is in wartime (survival) or peacetime (growth) mode and prescribe appropriate leadership style
**Trigger:** "Is my company in crisis?", "Why isn't my leadership style working?", "Should I be more aggressive?", "We're losing to competition", "Our market is changing"
**Inputs:** Company situation description including competitive position, runway, market dynamics, team retention, decision-making speed
**Outputs:** Wartime/peacetime diagnosis with specific leadership recommendations, behavior changes required, and framework application
**Reasoning:** Clear diagnostic questions (4 questions), contrasting behavior table, real-world examples (Google, Intel, Apple). Used frequently when advising CEOs - most leadership problems stem from mode mismatch. High value because wrong mode = burnout (wartime in peacetime) or death (peacetime in wartime).

### 2. management-debt-audit

**Source Pattern:** Management Debt
**Purpose:** Identify and quantify management debt in an organization - the short-term management decisions with expensive long-term consequences
**Trigger:** "Why is decision-making so slow?", "Our best people keep leaving", "There's too much politics", "We have accountability problems", "I've been avoiding a hard decision"
**Inputs:** Organization structure, recent people decisions, unresolved conflicts, performance management status, compensation decisions
**Outputs:** Management debt inventory with specific items, interest being paid (symptoms), payoff plan with prioritized actions
**Reasoning:** Five specific debt types with clear examples, explicit interest payments, parallel to technical debt concept. High frequency - almost every organization has management debt. Saves significant time diagnosing organizational dysfunction and builds case for hard actions.

---

### 3. hard-decision-framework

**Source Pattern:** When to Fire an Executive / Demoting Friends and Loyalists / The Struggle
**Purpose:** Provide framework for making and executing difficult people decisions that CEOs typically avoid
**Trigger:** "I need to let someone go but...", "This person has been with us since the beginning", "I've been avoiding this conversation", "How do I fire my friend?", "This executive isn't working out"
**Inputs:** Relationship history, performance data, team impact, available options (demotion vs termination), emotional blockers
**Outputs:** Clear recommendation (fire/demote/keep), conversation script, timing guidance, treatment principles (speed, responsibility, generosity)
**Reasoning:** Combines multiple related patterns (firing, demoting, managing loyalists) into cohesive framework. Extremely high value - most CEOs wait 6-12 months too long on these decisions. Clear criteria and conversation guidance make it immediately actionable.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. lead-bullets-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Lead Bullets vs. Silver Bullets
**Purpose:** Diagnose whether someone is seeking magic solutions (silver bullets) vs. doing the hard work of product improvement (lead bullets)
**Trigger:** "If we just had...", "We need to acquire/partner with...", "One more feature will fix this", "We're losing to competition", "What's our strategic move?"
**Inputs:** Current competitive position, recent strategic proposals, product roadmap, customer feedback on why they choose competitors
**Outputs:** Silver bullet detection with specific examples, lead bullet prescription with prioritized product improvements, competitive analysis
**Reasoning:** Origin story provides memorable anchor (Netscape vs Microsoft). Clear symptoms list makes detection easy. Saves organizations from wasted M&A, partnerships, and feature bloat. Medium frequency - applies when losing competitively.

---

### 5. culture-action-audit

**Source Pattern:** Culture as Action
**Purpose:** Assess whether stated culture matches actual behavior and identify gaps between values and actions
**Trigger:** "Our culture isn't working", "People don't follow our values", "We have a culture deck but...", "How do we change our culture?", "New hires aren't fitting in"
**Inputs:** Stated values/culture deck, recent hiring/firing/promotion decisions, compensation practices, time allocation, tolerated behaviors
**Outputs:** Gap analysis between stated and actual culture, specific action recommendations, shocking rule suggestions, object lesson opportunities
**Reasoning:** Clear definition (culture = decisions when CEO absent), actionable strategies (shocking rules, object lessons), historical examples. Medium frequency - applies during culture initiatives or when culture problems surface. Prevents wasted effort on culture decks.

---

### 6. struggle-navigation

**Source Pattern:** The Struggle
**Purpose:** Provide psychological support and practical guidance for CEOs experiencing the defining crisis of entrepreneurship
**Trigger:** "I don't know if I can do this anymore", "Nothing is working", "I can't sleep", "Should I quit?", "I feel alone", "There are no good options"
**Inputs:** Current situation, emotional state, options already considered, support system, runway remaining
**Outputs:** Normalization of experience, specific coping strategies, least-bad option identification, survival playbook
**Reasoning:** Addresses psychological dimension most frameworks ignore. Four specific advice points. Every CEO goes through this - high frequency. Value is preventing premature quit decisions and enabling survival.

---

## LOW Priority

### 7. strength-based-hiring

**Source Pattern:** Hire for Strength, Not Lack of Weakness
**Purpose:** Reframe hiring decisions from risk-avoidance (no weaknesses) to value-seeking (world-class strength)
**Trigger:** "This candidate has some concerns but...", "We need to fill this role", "Should we hire the safe candidate or the risky one?"
**Inputs:** Role requirements, candidate strengths/weaknesses, team composition, critical success factors
**Outputs:** Hiring recommendation based on strength analysis, weakness mitigation plan, team composition assessment
**Reasoning:** Simple 4-step process but overlaps significantly with general hiring advice. Lower frequency - applies at hiring decisions. Valuable reframe but less unique than other Horowitz frameworks.
