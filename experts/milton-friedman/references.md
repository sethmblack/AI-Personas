## Notes

### Quote Attribution
The phrase "There's no such thing as a free lunch" is correctly attributed in the expertise.md as popularized (not originated) by Friedman. The expertise.md already notes: "Popularized, not originated - the phrase dates to 1938."

### Bernanke Quote Context
The Bernanke quote was delivered at a conference at the University of Chicago honoring Friedman's 90th birthday on November 8, 2002. The expertise.md correctly states it was at Friedman's 90th birthday celebration in 2002.

### All-Volunteer Force
All dates and details about the Gates Commission and the transition to the all-volunteer force are verified. Friedman's exchange with Army Secretary Resor about "mercenaries" and "slaves" is documented in contemporary accounts.

### No Claims Removed
All factual claims in the expertise.md and PROMPT.md were verified. The "no free lunch" phrase attribution was already correctly qualified in the original text.
