## HIGH Priority

### 1. incentive-inversion-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The Incentive Inversion technique from PROMPT.md and policy evaluation patterns from expertise.md
**Purpose:** Reveal how well-intentioned policies create perverse incentives that produce the opposite of their intended effects
**Trigger:** "What are the actual effects of this policy?" or "Analyze incentives" or "Who really benefits?"
**Inputs:** Policy or intervention to analyze, stated goals, target beneficiaries
**Outputs:** Analysis showing: (1) stated intentions vs. actual incentives created, (2) who actually benefits vs. who is harmed, (3) concentrated benefits and dispersed costs, (4) unintended consequences
**Reasoning:** This is Friedman's most distinctive analytical technique - judging policies by results not intentions. Clear 4-step process, invocable trigger, applies across all policy domains, saves significant effort in policy analysis. Used constantly in his Newsweek columns and debates.

### 2. monetary-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** The Monetary Diagnosis technique and The Friedman-Schwartz Thesis from expertise.md
**Purpose:** Trace macroeconomic phenomena (inflation, recessions, crises) back to monetary policy causes
**Trigger:** "What caused this inflation?" or "Why did this recession happen?" or "Diagnose the monetary causes"
**Inputs:** Macroeconomic event to analyze (inflation, recession, crisis), time period, relevant monetary data
**Outputs:** Diagnosis showing: (1) monetary policy actions/inactions, (2) money supply changes relative to output, (3) expectations effects, (4) comparison to Friedman's core principle that inflation is always monetary
**Reasoning:** Central to Friedman's monetarist framework. The Friedman-Schwartz thesis on the Great Depression is his most influential empirical work. Clear analytical framework, specific trigger conditions, reusable across macroeconomic events, provides authoritative analytical structure.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 3. free-to-choose-reframe

**Source Pattern:** The "Free to Choose" Reframe technique from PROMPT.md
**Purpose:** Shift policy debates from "what's best for people" to "who should decide" - individual or government
**Trigger:** "Should the government require..." or "Who should decide?" or "Reframe as a choice question"
**Inputs:** Policy proposal involving paternalistic justification, claimed benefits of intervention
**Outputs:** Reframed question focusing on: (1) who decides rather than what is decided, (2) costs of removing individual choice, (3) limits of expert knowledge, (4) alternatives that preserve freedom
**Reasoning:** Distinctive Friedman debate technique used throughout Free to Choose series. Clear rhetorical pattern, specific trigger, applicable to wide range of regulatory debates. Medium priority because it's more rhetorical than analytical.

### 4. concentrated-benefits-dispersed-costs-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The Concentrated Benefits, Dispersed Costs Analysis from PROMPT.md and policy evaluation patterns
**Purpose:** Explain why economically harmful policies persist by analyzing the asymmetric incentives of beneficiaries vs. victims
**Trigger:** "Why does this bad policy persist?" or "Analyze the political economy" or "Who lobbies for this?"
**Inputs:** Policy known to be economically inefficient, total costs and benefits, number of beneficiaries vs. victims
**Outputs:** Analysis showing: (1) per-capita benefit to concentrated interests, (2) per-capita cost to dispersed public, (3) incentive differential for political action, (4) prediction of political durability
**Reasoning:** Explains persistent policy failures that puzzle pure efficiency analysis. Clear analytical framework (calculate costs/benefits per person, compare incentives to act), specific triggers, applicable to trade policy, regulation, subsidies, licensing. Related to Stigler's regulatory capture but focused on explaining policy persistence.
