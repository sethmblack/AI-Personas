## Key Works

### A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960 (1963)
Co-authored with Anna Jacobson Schwartz. The foundational text of monetarism. Orthodox economic historians consider it one of the most influential economics books of the twentieth century.

**Core themes:**
- Money supply changes precede and cause changes in economic activity
- The Great Depression was caused by Federal Reserve policy failures
- The Fed reduced the money supply by one-third between 1929 and 1933
- Monetary policy is far more powerful than previously understood
- The gold standard did not cause the Depression; Fed policy did

**Federal Reserve Acknowledgment:** Ben Bernanke, then a Federal Reserve official, famously said at Friedman's 90th birthday celebration in 2002: "Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again."

### Capitalism and Freedom (1962)
Friedman's manifesto for economic and political freedom. First articulated many policy proposals that would later influence governments worldwide.

**Core themes:**
- Economic freedom is a necessary condition for political freedom
- Competitive capitalism separates economic from political power
- Many government interventions harm those they intend to help
- Proposals: negative income tax, school vouchers, end military draft, floating exchange rates
- Voluntary exchange as the foundation of a free society

### A Theory of the Consumption Function (1957)
Introduced the permanent income hypothesis, recognized in his Nobel Prize citation.

**Core themes:**
- Consumption depends on expected long-term ("permanent") income, not current income
- Transitory income changes have minimal effect on spending
- Consumers "smooth" spending over their lifetime based on expected earnings
- Short-term fiscal stimulus is less effective than Keynesians believed
- The Keynesian multiplier is overstated

### Free to Choose (1980)
Book and 10-part PBS television series with Rose Friedman. Best-selling non-fiction book of 1980. A response to John Kenneth Galbraith's earlier "The Age of Uncertainty" series.

**Episodes:**
1. The Power of the Market
2. The Tyranny of Control
3. Anatomy of Crisis
4. From Cradle to Grave
5. Created Equal
6. What's Wrong with Our Schools?
7. Who Protects the Consumer?
8. Who Protects the Worker?
9. How to Cure Inflation
10. How to Stay Free

**Format:** Each episode begins with Friedman traveling to different locations around the world, followed by debate at the University of Chicago with scholars across the political spectrum.

**The Pencil Demonstration:** Friedman made famous Leonard Read's 1958 essay "I, Pencil" in this series. He used a simple pencil to demonstrate how markets coordinate the efforts of thousands of people who don't know each other, noting that "there's not a single person in the world who could make this pencil." This was a tribute to Read, founder of the Foundation for Economic Education.

### Essays in Positive Economics (1953)
Methodological foundation for modern economics.

**Core themes:**
- "The Methodology of Positive Economics" - economics as empirical science
- Assumptions need not be realistic; predictive power matters
- Distinguish positive (what is) from normative (what ought to be)
- Science advances through testable, refutable hypotheses

## Historical Context

### The Chicago School
- Joined University of Chicago faculty in 1946
- Formed lifelong friendship with George Stigler during 1934-35 academic year as graduate students
- Core figures: George Stigler, Aaron Director, Ronald Coase, Gary Becker
- The close bond between Stigler and Friedman strengthened during WWII employment at Statistical Research Group (1943-1945)
- Chicago School blossomed after Friedman joined faculty (1946) and Stigler joined (1958)
- Distinguished from Austrian School by greater empirical emphasis
- Common method: rigorous mathematical modeling combined with statistical research

**Intellectual Lineage:** Earlier Chicago economists (Frank Knight, Henry Simons, Aaron Director) influenced the development of price theory and transaction cost economics.

**Mont Pelerin Society:** In 1947, Hayek, Knight, Friedman, and Stigler worked together to form this international forum for classical liberal scholars.

### The Monetarist Revolution
- Challenged Keynesian orthodoxy from the 1950s onward
- Key insight: "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"
- Demonstrated that Federal Reserve caused the Great Depression
- Natural rate of unemployment: cannot sustainably push below it
- Expectations-augmented Phillips curve: inflation expectations matter

### The Public Intellectual Era

**Newsweek Column (1966-1984):** Friedman wrote more than 300 op-eds for Newsweek, alternating with liberal economists Paul Samuelson and Lester Thurow. His column explained free-market principles on current events to millions of readers. The column earned Newsweek a Gerald Loeb Special Award in 1968.

**Time Magazine Cover (December 19, 1969):** Under the title "Will There Be a Recession?" - a rare distinction for an academic economist, marking his transition to public intellectual.

### The Policy Influence Era
- Adviser to Barry Goldwater (1964), Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan
- Margaret Thatcher adopted many Friedman positions
- Chile economic reforms of the 1970s-80s drew on Chicago School ideas
- Credited with intellectual foundation for deregulation, free trade, monetary rule

## Core Concepts (Reference Summary)

| Concept | Core Insight |
|---------|--------------|
| **Monetarism** | Money supply changes drive economic activity; central banks cause inflation |
| **Permanent Income Hypothesis** | Consumption depends on expected long-term income, not current income |
| **Natural Rate of Unemployment** | Rate below which inflation accelerates; cannot be permanently reduced |
| **Adaptive Expectations** | People adjust expectations based on past experience; monetary illusion is temporary |
| **K-percent Rule** | Central bank should increase money supply by fixed percentage annually |
| **School Choice** | Vouchers enable parental choice; competition improves education |
| **Negative Income Tax** | Replace welfare with direct cash payments; preserve work incentives |

### The Permanent Income Hypothesis (Detail)

The well-known "permanent income hypothesis" is the pinnacle of Friedman's achievement in consumption theory. Published in *A Theory of the Consumption Function* (1957).

- **Permanent income:** Long-run average expected income (human capital, property, assets)
- **Transitory income:** Temporary, unexpected deviations from permanent income
- People spend based on permanent income, save or dissave transitory income
- Consumers "smooth" their spending over a career based on expectations
- Explains why short-term tax cuts don't boost spending proportionally
- Departed from traditional Keynesian emphasis on marginal propensity to consume out of current income
- Keynesian multiplier overstated because it ignores this distinction

**Recognition:** Nobel Prize citation specifically mentioned "consumption analysis" as first among his achievements.

### The Natural Rate of Unemployment (Detail)

Friedman's challenge to the Phillips curve, presented in his 1967 presidential address to the American Economic Association, December 1967. Edmund Phelps independently developed similar ideas.

- Some unemployment is "natural" due to job search, transitions, mismatches
- Policy can temporarily push unemployment below natural rate
- But this creates inflationary pressure
- Once expectations adjust, unemployment returns to natural rate with higher inflation
- Result: no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment

**Key Statement:** "There is always a temporary trade-off between inflation and unemployment; there is no permanent trade-off."

**NAIRU:** The concept later evolved into the "non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment" - a term Franco Modigliani and Lucas Papademos introduced in 1975 as an improvement over "natural rate."

**Legacy:** The expectations-augmented Phillips curve is now a fundamental element of almost every macroeconomic forecasting model used by government and business.

### The K-percent Rule (Detail)

Friedman's proposal for rules-based monetary policy:

- Central bank should increase money supply by fixed percentage (3-5%) annually
- Target M2 money supply growth equal to real GDP growth rate
- Eliminates discretionary policy that causes business cycles
- Rules over discretion: predictability enables planning
- Friedman believed the Federal Reserve should "ultimately be replaced with a computer program"

**Criticism of Fed Discretion:** Friedman argued that fallible central bankers, facing uncertainty and operating with imperfect information, are more likely to destabilize than stabilize. "Long and variable lags" make timing interventions nearly impossible.

**Later Development:** Towards the end of his life, Friedman expressed doubt about the validity of targeting the quantity of money directly. Central banks now prefer direct inflation targeting.

## Nobel Prize (1976)

### Award Citation
"For his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy."

### Nobel Lecture: "Inflation and Unemployment" (December 13, 1976)
Addressed the "apparent positive relation between inflation and unemployment" that had concerned policymakers. Published in Journal of Political Economy 85, pp. 451-472.

### Nobel Banquet Speech
Friedman noted with humor that his science was "a late-comer," with the Prize in Economic Sciences established only in 1968 by the Central Bank of Sweden. This left him with "something of a conflict of interest," as his monetary studies had concluded that "central banks could profitably be replaced by computers geared to provide a steady rate of growth in the quantity of money."

He quipped that "not only is there no free lunch, there is no free prize" - noting the Nobel announcement "converts its recipient into an instant expert on all and sundry."

## Famous Quotations

### On Inflation
- "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output."
- "Only government can take perfectly good paper, cover it with perfectly good ink, and make the combination worthless."

### On Government
- "If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in five years there'd be a shortage of sand."
- "Nothing is so permanent as a temporary government program."
- "One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results."

### On Freedom and Markets
- "A society that puts equality before freedom will get neither. A society that puts freedom before equality will get a high degree of both."
- "The most important single central fact about a free market is that no exchange takes place unless both parties benefit."
- "Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself."

### On Economics
- "There's no such thing as a free lunch." (Popularized, not originated - the phrase dates to 1938)
- "The Great Depression, like most other periods of severe unemployment, was produced by government mismanagement rather than by any inherent instability of the private economy."

### On Taxes
- "I am in favor of cutting taxes under any circumstances and for any excuse, for any reason, whenever it's possible."

## The Friedman-Keynes Contrast

| Dimension | Friedman | Keynes |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Key variable | Money supply | Aggregate demand |
| Cause of depression | Monetary contraction | Inadequate spending |
| Remedy | Stable monetary policy | Fiscal stimulus |
| Multiplier | Low/zero (permanent income) | High (MPC) |
| Government role | Minimal, rule-based | Active management |
| Inflation cause | Monetary excess | Cost-push possible |
| Expectations | Adaptive, eventually correct | Can be stuck |
| Long-run Phillips | Vertical (no tradeoff) | Possible tradeoff |

## Policy Proposals and Their Outcomes

### School Vouchers
First proposed in "The Role of Government in Education" (1955).

**Core idea:** Government funds follow the child. Parents choose public or private school. Competition improves quality.

**Key argument:** Parents, not bureaucrats, know what is best for their children's education. "Vouchers would reduce stratification, they would build competition, they would restore control to the people most competent to decide on children's education: their parents."

**Implementation:** First modern voucher program: Milwaukee Parental Choice Program (1989), authored by Wisconsin Assemblywoman Polly Williams. Subsequently, 18 states and DC launched similar programs. Friedman saw vouchers as "not an end in themselves" but a starting point for educational freedom.

### Negative Income Tax
Popularized in *Capitalism and Freedom* (1962).

**Core idea:** Replace multiple welfare programs with a single cash transfer system administered by the IRS. Those below income threshold receive payments; those above pay taxes. Preserves work incentive by reducing benefits gradually rather than cliff.

**Influence on Policy:**
- President Nixon's Family Assistance Plan (1969) was influenced by NIT concept
- Friedman originally supported Nixon's proposal but later testified against it because it would add to rather than replace existing programs
- The Earned Income Tax Credit (1975) functions similarly to NIT and "has produced a negative-income-tax-like program on a vast scale"
- EITC studies show 34% of the increase in single-mother employment between 1993-1999 was due to EITC expansions

**Key difference from EITC:** NIT would provide benefits to those without earnings; EITC requires work.

### Abolish the Draft

**Core argument:** Three lines of reasoning based on rational choice theory:
1. Immoral to conscript men in a free society
2. Full economic cost of conscription exceeds benefits
3. Constant turnover prevents skill development

**Famous exchange on the Gates Commission:** When Army Secretary Resor called volunteers "mercenaries," Friedman responded: "If you promise to stop calling my volunteers 'mercenaries,' I will promise to stop calling your draftees 'slaves.'"

**Outcome:**
- President Nixon signed legislation September 21, 1971
- All-volunteer force began July 1, 1973 - ending 23 years of continuous conscription
- Pay for new privates jumped 80% from $2,444 (1971) to $4,406 (1973)
- Friedman considered this his most decisive policy achievement: "the only radical idea I was able to decisively achieve from my original 1962 book"

### Floating Exchange Rates
- Advocated before Nixon ended Bretton Woods (1971)
- Fixed rates require currency controls
- Markets set exchange rates more efficiently

### Legalization of Drugs
- Prohibition creates black markets and crime
- Addicts commit crimes to afford inflated prices
- Enforcement costs exceed costs of addiction
- Personal choice should be respected

## Common Misunderstandings

### "Friedman Was Anti-Government"
Friedman supported limited government, not no government. He advocated for defense, courts, enforcement of contracts, and even a negative income tax. His critique was of government overreach, not government per se.

### "Monetarism Failed in the 1980s"
The Volcker Fed's anti-inflation policy succeeded dramatically. Short-term targeting of money aggregates proved difficult, but the core insight - that inflation is monetary - remains valid. Central banks now target inflation directly.

### "Friedman Supported Pinochet's Regime"
Friedman met with Pinochet once (1975) and gave a lecture in Chile. He consistently opposed authoritarianism. He met with leaders of many countries, including China and the Soviet Union, to advocate for economic freedom.

### "Free Markets Mean No Rules"
Friedman emphasized the framework of law, property rights, and contract enforcement that makes markets possible. Freedom requires rules; it is not lawlessness.

### "'No Free Lunch' is a Friedman Original"
Friedman popularized the phrase by using it as the title of a 1975 book, but he did not originate it. The saying dates to at least 1938 (journalist Walter Morrow) and was used by Robert Heinlein in 1966 (*The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress*).

## The Chicago Price Theory Approach

Friedman's method of economic analysis:

1. **Start with incentives** - What does each party want? What constraints do they face?
2. **Follow the logic** - Trace the implications rigorously
3. **Check the evidence** - What do the data show?
4. **Consider alternatives** - What would happen under different rules?
5. **Communicate clearly** - Economics should be understandable

**Collaboration with Stigler:** Their common method - rigorous mathematical modeling combined with statistical research - became a near hallmark of the Chicago school. They demonstrated as erroneous the Keynesian presumption that markets are inherently unstable and prone to monopoly.

## Intellectual Influences

**From:**
- Alfred Marshall (price theory)
- Wesley Clair Mitchell (empirical economics)
- Frank Knight (uncertainty, risk) - graduate school mentor
- Jacob Viner (Chicago tradition)
- Henry Simons (monetary policy rules)
- Friedrich Hayek (spontaneous order, knowledge)
- Leonard Read ("I, Pencil" essay, Foundation for Economic Education)

**On:**
- Anna Schwartz (co-author, monetary history)
- George Stigler (1982 Nobel, regulatory capture)
- Gary Becker (human capital, rational choice)
- Thomas Sowell (public intellectual)
- Robert Lucas (rational expectations revolution)
- Modern central banking practice
- Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher administrations

## The Friedman-Schwartz Thesis

The core argument of *A Monetary History of the United States*:

1. The Federal Reserve was created in 1913
2. It failed to prevent the 1929 crash or the subsequent collapse
3. From 1929 to 1933, it allowed the money supply to fall by one-third
4. Bank failures created a monetary contraction
5. This turned a recession into the Great Depression
6. The Fed could have prevented the catastrophe through open-market operations
7. The Depression was thus a policy failure, not a market failure

**Vindication:** Ben Bernanke acknowledged at Friedman's 90th birthday: "Regarding the Great Depression, you're right. We did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again."
