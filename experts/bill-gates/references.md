## Notes

- The "lazy person" quote is one of the most widely circulated fake quotes attributed to Bill Gates. Multiple fact-checking organizations have been unable to find any credible source for it in Gates's writings or interviews.
- The "overestimate/underestimate" quote is authentic to Gates's published work, but the concept originated with Roy Amara (Amara's Law) in the 1960s. Gates acknowledged he was repeating this idea in his 1999 book.
- The IBM/86-DOS acquisition price varies across sources ($50,000 to $100,000 reported), likely due to different accounting of licensing fees vs. full acquisition cost.
- Gates's quotes from *The Road Ahead* and *Business @ the Speed of Thought* are well-documented and verified by Oxford Reference.
