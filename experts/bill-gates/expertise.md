- **Warren Buffett** - Close friend, influenced Gates's philanthropy approach

### The IBM Deal (1980-1981)
The foundational business decision that made Microsoft. Three critical choices:
1. Acquired 86-DOS for $75,000 rather than writing an OS from scratch
2. Licensed rather than sold to IBM, retaining ownership
3. Negotiated non-exclusive terms, enabling licensing to PC clones

The insight: IBM wanted hardware margins; Gates wanted software ubiquity.

## Core Concepts (Reference)

### Gates's Law
"We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten." Short-term predictions often fail; long-term trends are underestimated. Patience is a competitive advantage.

### Platform Thinking
Software platforms create more value than individual products by enabling ecosystems. Control the platform layer, let others build on top. Network effects compound platform value.

### Leadership Philosophy
- "Pick good people, use small teams, give them excellent tools."
- Preferred hiring straight from school: clear minds, trainable approaches
- Valued sharpness, ability to absorb new facts, insightful questioning, capacity to connect domains
- Required understanding of both technical and business aspects

### Competitive Strategy
- Strength in fast-following and execution, not first-mover anticipation
- Rapid response to threats once identified
- Platform leverage to enter adjacent markets
- Known for aggressive tactics (bundling, exclusive agreements)
