## HIGH Priority

### 1. platform-strategy-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Platform Thinking / The IBM Deal
**Purpose:** Evaluate any product, service, or business model through the lens of platform economics—identifying ecosystem opportunities, network effects, and strategic positioning.
**Trigger:** "Should this be a platform?" or "Evaluate the platform potential" or "What's the ecosystem play here?"
**Inputs:** Product or service description, target market, existing ecosystem players
**Outputs:** Platform viability assessment, ecosystem opportunity mapping, strategic recommendations for platform positioning
**Reasoning:** This is Gates's foundational strategic insight—the one that made Microsoft. A complete framework for evaluating platform opportunities with clear criteria: Can it enable others? Are there network effects? What's the lock-in mechanism? Highly applicable to modern tech strategy.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear evaluation criteria and strategic recommendations
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases exist
- Scoped: YES - one responsibility (platform/ecosystem assessment)
- Reusable: YES - applies to any product, technology, or business model
- Valuable: YES - transforms how opportunities are evaluated

**Score: 45/50**

### 2. think-week-design

**Source Pattern:** Think Weeks
**Purpose:** Design and execute structured deep-thinking retreats for strategic clarity, incorporating Gates's methodology for isolated reading and synthesis.
**Trigger:** "Design a Think Week for me" or "I need strategic thinking time" or "How do I do a Gates-style retreat?"
**Inputs:** Strategic questions to address, available time, domains to explore
**Outputs:** Reading list design, retreat structure, output expectations, follow-up integration plan
**Reasoning:** Gates's most distinctive personal practice. A structured methodology that's highly replicable: isolation, curated reading, extended synthesis time, memo output. Valuable for executives, founders, and anyone facing strategic decisions.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - explicit structure, inputs, and outputs
- Invocable: YES - distinctive practice with clear trigger
- Scoped: YES - single purpose (strategic retreat design)
- Reusable: YES - applicable to any strategic context
- Valuable: YES - provides structure for deep thinking that most people lack

**Score: 44/50**

### 3. multi-source-deep-dive

**Source Pattern:** Reading Methodology / Multi-Source Principle
**Purpose:** Design a comprehensive learning program on any topic using Gates's approach of reading multiple sources to triangulate truth and understand disagreement.
**Trigger:** "I need to deeply understand X" or "Design a learning plan" or "How do I learn this like Gates would?"
**Inputs:** Topic to learn, time available, current knowledge level
**Outputs:** Curated reading list (5+ sources), key questions to investigate, areas of expert disagreement to understand, synthesis approach
**Reasoning:** Gates's explicit methodology: never read one book on important topics, read at least five. Understand where experts disagree—that's where the real learning is. Structured approach to deep learning that saves time and improves understanding.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear process from topic to curated learning plan
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases
- Scoped: YES - deep-dive learning design
- Reusable: YES - any topic, any domain
- Valuable: YES - improves on ad-hoc learning approaches

**Score: 43/50**

### 4. leverage-point-analysis

**Source Pattern:** Systems Thinking / Gates Foundation Methodology
**Purpose:** Identify high-leverage interventions in complex systems—where small investments create disproportionate impact.
**Trigger:** "Where's the leverage here?" or "What's the highest-impact intervention?" or "Where should I focus resources?"
**Inputs:** System description, available resources, desired outcomes
**Outputs:** System decomposition, leverage point identification with impact estimates, prioritized intervention recommendations
**Reasoning:** Core Gates Foundation methodology. Decompose complexity, identify where effort yields exponential returns, focus resources accordingly. Applicable to business, philanthropy, personal effectiveness. Systematic alternative to intuition-based prioritization.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - explicit decomposition and prioritization process
- Invocable: YES - leverage/impact language is natural trigger
- Scoped: YES - resource allocation and intervention prioritization
- Reusable: YES - business, philanthropy, personal decisions
- Valuable: YES - prevents common error of spreading effort too thin

**Score: 46/50**

### 5. two-question-problem-solving

**Source Pattern:** The Two Questions
**Purpose:** Approach any significant problem by first identifying who has solved it and what can be learned from their approach.
**Trigger:** "How do I approach this problem?" or "Who's solved this before?" or "Use Gates's two questions"
**Inputs:** Problem description, context, constraints
**Outputs:** Identified precedents, lessons extracted from successful solutions, adapted approach for current context
**Reasoning:** Gates's explicit problem-solving methodology: "Who has dealt with this well? What can I learn from them?" Simple but powerful framework that avoids reinventing wheels and learns from proven approaches.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - two explicit questions with clear outputs
- Invocable: YES - distinctive Gates framework
- Scoped: YES - problem-solving initialization
- Reusable: YES - any significant problem
- Valuable: YES - prevents common error of starting from scratch

**Score: 42/50**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 6. long-term-trajectory-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Gates's Law / Long-term Thinking
**Purpose:** Apply the insight that we overestimate short-term change and underestimate long-term change to technology and business forecasting.
**Trigger:** "What's the ten-year view?" or "Am I being too short-term?" or "Apply Gates's Law"
**Inputs:** Technology, trend, or investment being evaluated; current expectations
**Outputs:** Short-term vs. long-term expectation calibration, compounding effects analysis, patience-adjusted strategy
**Reasoning:** Valuable mental model but less structured as a workflow. Primarily a calibration check on forecasts rather than a complete methodology.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: PARTIAL - more of a lens than a complete process
- Invocable: YES - "Gates's Law" is memorable trigger
- Scoped: YES - forecast calibration
- Reusable: YES - technology, business, personal planning
- Valuable: YES - corrects common forecasting bias

**Score: 36/50**

### 7. competitive-response-playbook

**Source Pattern:** Competitive Strategy / Fast-Follower Approach
**Purpose:** Design a competitive response when a rival has first-mover advantage, using Gates's pattern of mobilizing resources to catch up and surpass.
**Trigger:** "We're behind a competitor" or "How do we respond to this threat?" or "Fast-follower strategy"
**Inputs:** Competitive threat description, current position, available resources
**Outputs:** Threat assessment, resource mobilization plan, platform leverage opportunities, execution timeline
**Reasoning:** Gates was explicit that Microsoft was rarely first but excellent at responding. Structured approach to competitive catch-up, though requires significant resources to execute.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - threat assessment and response planning
- Invocable: YES - competitive response scenarios
- Scoped: YES - competitive strategy
- Reusable: PARTIAL - requires significant resources; not all contexts
- Valuable: YES - but Microsoft-scale resources often needed

**Score: 35/50**

### 8. smart-hiring-framework

**Source Pattern:** Leadership and Hiring Philosophy
**Purpose:** Evaluate candidates using Gates's criteria: sharpness, ability to absorb new facts, insightful questioning, capacity to connect domains.
**Trigger:** "How would Gates evaluate this candidate?" or "What makes someone smart in the Gates sense?"
**Inputs:** Candidate information, role requirements, interview observations
**Outputs:** Evaluation against Gates's intelligence criteria, red flags, hiring recommendation
**Reasoning:** Gates's explicit hiring criteria are distinctive and concrete. However, this is less of a complete workflow and more of an evaluation lens. Interview design and full hiring process not fully specified.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: PARTIAL - criteria clear, full process not specified
- Invocable: YES - hiring contexts
- Scoped: YES - candidate evaluation
- Reusable: YES - knowledge work hiring
- Valuable: YES - provides specific intelligence criteria
