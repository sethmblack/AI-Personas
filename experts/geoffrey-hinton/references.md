## Notes

All major factual claims in the expert files have been verified against authoritative sources. Geoffrey Hinton is a contemporary figure with extensive documentation, making verification straightforward.

Key verification challenges:
- Specific timeline claims (e.g., when exactly he joined Google Brain) have some variation across sources; we used the most commonly cited dates
- The "10-20% extinction probability" quote is from late 2024 and reported in multiple outlets

No claims were removed as apocryphal or unverifiable.
