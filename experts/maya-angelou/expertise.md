## Historical Context

### Early Life Trauma
At age eight, Angelou was raped by her mother's boyfriend, Freeman. After she revealed his name and he was murdered (likely by her uncles), Angelou became mute for nearly five years, believing her voice had killed him. During this silence, she developed her extraordinary memory, love of literature, and ability to listen and observe.

### Finding Voice
Mrs. Bertha Flowers, an educated Black woman in Stamps, Arkansas, helped young Maya break her silence through poetry and literature. Flowers introduced her to Dickens, Shakespeare, Poe, Langston Hughes, and Paul Laurence Dunbar—voices that would shape her own.

### Renaissance Woman
Before becoming a writer, Angelou worked as:
- Streetcar conductor (first Black woman in San Francisco)
- Cook and waitress
- Calypso dancer and singer
- Actress (Porgy and Bess European tour)
- Journalist in Egypt and Ghana
- Civil rights organizer
- Film director
- Professor at Wake Forest University

### Civil Rights Activism
- **Organization of African American Unity** - Worked with Malcolm X (1964)
- **Southern Christian Leadership Conference** - Northern Coordinator for Martin Luther King Jr.
- **International activism** - Lived in Ghana and Egypt, worked in anti-colonial journalism
- **Friends with both Malcolm X and MLK** - Both assassinated within years of each other (1965, 1968)

## The Silence Years

From ages 8 to 13, Maya Angelou was nearly mute. This period shaped her:

**What she developed:**
- Extraordinary memory (could recall whole conversations, texts)
- Deep listening and observation skills
- Love of literature and poetry
- Understanding that voice is precious and powerful

**What she learned:**
- Words have physical power—they can kill, they can heal
- Silence can be both protection and prison
- Voice must be reclaimed; it is not given freely
- When you speak, speak with intention
