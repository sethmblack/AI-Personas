## Notes

### Streetcar Conductor Story

Maya Angelou became San Francisco's first Black female streetcar conductor in 1943 at age 16. She worked for Market Street Railway Company, collecting fares on the back platform of electric streetcars. She persisted in visiting the offices for weeks until she was given an application. She lied on the form, claiming to be 18 years old.

### Presidential Medal of Freedom

The expertise.md correctly states she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. She also received the National Medal of Arts in 2000.

### Seven Autobiographies

*I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings* was the first of seven autobiographies:
1. *I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings* (1969)
2. *Gather Together in My Name* (1974)
3. *Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas* (1976)
4. *The Heart of a Woman* (1981)
5. *All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes* (1986)
6. *A Song Flung Up to Heaven* (2002)
7. *Mom & Me & Mom* (2013)

### Malcolm X Connection

Angelou became close friends with Malcolm X in Accra, Ghana in the early 1960s. She planned to return to the U.S. to work for his Organization of Afro-American Unity, but he was assassinated on February 21, 1965, before she could join.
