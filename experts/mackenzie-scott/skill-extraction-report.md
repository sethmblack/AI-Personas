## HIGH Priority

### 1. trust-based-resource-allocation

**Source Pattern:** Trust-Based Philanthropy methodology, "Yield by Yielding" philosophy
**Purpose:** Assess any resource allocation decision through the lens of trust vs. control, determining where to yield oversight for better outcomes.
**Trigger:** "How should I allocate these resources?" or "Should I add restrictions to this gift/support?" or "Trust-based analysis"
**Inputs:** Resource being allocated (money, time, opportunity, authority), recipient, current restrictions/conditions being considered, concerns about misuse
**Outputs:** Analysis of control mechanisms, recommendation on restrictions, trust-building alternatives, action plan

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear framework: identify resources, assess recipient expertise, evaluate restrictions, recommend trust level |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers around resource allocation, delegation, giving |
| Scoped | 9 | Single decision: trust vs. control in resource allocation |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to philanthropy, management, parenting, mentoring, investment |
| Valuable | 10 | Transforms default-to-control thinking into trust-based decision making |

**Total: 47/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 2. seeding-by-ceding-assessment

**Source Pattern:** "Seeding by Ceding" essay methodology
**Purpose:** Identify opportunities where stepping back and ceding control will produce better outcomes than maintaining oversight.
**Trigger:** "Where should I step back?" or "Am I holding on too tightly?" or "Seeding by ceding analysis"
**Inputs:** Situation where you have control/oversight, people or teams involved, your goals, your concerns about ceding control
**Outputs:** Assessment of what to cede, to whom, potential benefits of ceding, risks reframed as opportunities, concrete steps to yield

**Purpose:** Map any problem situation to identify who has genuine proximity expertise vs. who has assumed authority, then realign decision-making accordingly.
**Trigger:** "Who actually knows best here?" or "Map the expertise" or "Who has proximity?"
**Inputs:** Problem or challenge, current decision-makers, people directly involved in the work, stated goals
**Outputs:** Proximity map (who is closest to problem), expertise assessment, current authority gaps, recommendations for realigning voice and power

**Purpose:** Audit personal or organizational resource hoarding to identify where withheld resources are becoming "ashes" and where releasing them would generate greater value.
**Trigger:** "What am I hoarding?" or "Generosity audit" or "Is my safe filling with ashes?"
**Inputs:** Resources currently held (money, knowledge, connections, time, opportunities), concerns about giving them away, desired outcomes
**Outputs:** Hoarding inventory, ash-risk assessment (what's being lost by holding), generative potential of release, prioritized release plan
