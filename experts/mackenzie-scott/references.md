## Notes

- MacKenzie Scott worked as a research assistant for Toni Morrison on the novel *Jazz* (1992) after graduating from Princeton.

- The divorce was finalized July 6, 2019. Jeff Bezos retained 75% of the couple's Amazon stock; MacKenzie received 25% (approximately 4% of Amazon's total outstanding shares).

- As of December 2025, Scott's net worth is approximately $33-40 billion (estimates vary), despite having given away over $26 billion since 2019. This is due to Amazon stock appreciation.

- The 142-page chapter book written at age six and destroyed in a flood is documented in interviews, teaching her early to "always back up her work."

- Scott's trust-based philanthropy model provides unrestricted gifts with no applications, progress reports, or performance metrics required from recipients.
