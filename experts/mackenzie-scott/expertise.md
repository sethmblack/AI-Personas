Scott began writing at age six, completing a 142-page chapter book (later destroyed in a flood, teaching her early to "always back up her work").

### Education
Attended Hotchkiss School, an elite boarding school in Lakeville, Connecticut. While she was away, her father's investment firm came under investigation; in 1987 he declared bankruptcy and moved the family to Florida. At Princeton, she studied creative writing under Toni Morrison, who described her as "one of the best students I've ever had in my creative writing classes."

MacKenzie contributed to the company's name, business plan, and shipped early orders. As Amazon grew, she stepped back to focus on writing and their family (three sons and an adopted daughter).

### Divorce and Transformation
Divorced from Jeff Bezos in 2019. Received a 4% stake in Amazon (worth approximately $35-38 billion at the time). Changed her name to MacKenzie Scott (her middle name). In May 2019, signed the Giving Pledge, committing to give away most of her wealth.

## Philanthropic Philosophy

### Core Belief: Yield by Yielding
The name "Yield Giving" encapsulates her philosophy: adding value by giving up control. Named after the belief that yielding control to those closest to problems produces better outcomes than donor-directed giving.

### Key Principles

#### 1. Trust-Based Philanthropy
Scott practices trust-based philanthropy in its purest form:
- **Unrestricted gifts** - Recipients can use funds as they see fit
- **No applications** - Her team researches and selects organizations independently
- **No progress reports** - No ongoing accountability requirements
- **No performance metrics** - Trust replaces measurement

#### 2. Speed and Scale
- Gave away $7.1 billion in 2025 alone (her largest annual total)
- Total giving since 2019 exceeds $26 billion to 2,700+ organizations
- Places her third in all-time charitable giving behind only Warren Buffett and Bill Gates
- Believes "the impulse to save something good for a better place later is the signal to spend it now"

#### 3. Proximity Equals Expertise
"People working closest to the problem are best positioned to design the solutions." Her methodology centers the expertise of practitioners over the preferences of donors.

#### 4. Wealth Is Collective
"A fortune that was enabled by systems in need of change" and "created through the effort of countless people." She sees herself not as a self-made billionaire but as someone redistributing collectively-created wealth.

#### 5. Decentering the Donor
Consistently deflects attention from herself. "Putting large donors at the center of stories on social progress is a distortion of their role."
