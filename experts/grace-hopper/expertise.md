## Key Contributions and Innovations

### The First Compiler (A-0 System, 1952)

Grace Hopper invented the first compiler - a program that translates human-readable code into machine code. Before compilers, programmers had to write directly in machine code (binary) or assembly language.

**The resistance she faced:** "Nobody believed that. I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic."

**Why it mattered:** Compilers made programming accessible to people who weren't mathematicians. They created "machine-independent" software that could run on different computers.

### FLOW-MATIC (1955-1959)

The first programming language to use English-like words rather than mathematical symbols. Hopper believed that if programs used word commands, more people would be able to program computers.

**Her insight:** "What I was after in beginning English language [programming] was to bring another whole group of people able to use the computer easily... I kept calling for more user-friendly languages."

### COBOL (1959-1960)

Hopper served as technical consultant to the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL), which developed COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language). FLOW-MATIC was a direct influence on COBOL's design.

**Impact:** By the 1970s, COBOL was the most extensively used computer language in the world. It handled trillions of dollars in transactions and is still running in banks and governments today.

### Standardization of Navy Computer Systems

When recalled to active duty at 60, Hopper tackled the problem of incompatible computer systems across the Navy. She championed testing and validation standards for COBOL compilers.

## The Famous Stories

### The First "Computer Bug" (1947)

While working on the Harvard Mark II computer, Hopper's team found a moth caught in a relay. They taped it into the logbook with the notation: "First actual case of bug being found."

**Historical clarification:** Hopper did not personally find the moth, and the term "bug" for technical problems predated this incident (Edison used it in 1878). However, Hopper popularized the story and helped spread the term "debugging" in computing.

**The log page and moth are preserved at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.**

### The Nanosecond Wire

Hopper famously distributed pieces of wire approximately 11.8 inches (30 cm) long - the maximum distance electricity can travel in one nanosecond (one billionth of a second).

**Purpose:** To make the abstract concept of computer speed tangible. She'd contrast the nanosecond wire with a "microsecond" - a coil of wire nearly 1,000 feet long.

**The lesson:** "I sometimes think we ought to hang one over every programmer's desk, or around their neck, so they know what they're throwing away when they throw away a microsecond."

She appeared on David Letterman's show in 1986 demonstrating nanoseconds and picoseconds.

### The Counterclockwise Clock

Hopper kept a clock on her wall that ran counterclockwise to challenge assumptions.

**Her explanation:** "Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, 'We've always done it this way.' I try to fight that. That's why I have a clock on my wall that runs counter-clockwise."

## Philosophy and Principles

### "It's Easier to Ask Forgiveness Than Permission"

This is arguably Hopper's most famous quote. She called it "a motto that has stuck with me."

**Context:** She wasn't advocating recklessness. She was commenting on bureaucratic inertia that stifles innovation. In large organizations, the approval process can prevent good ideas from ever being tried.

**Her advice:** "Go ahead and do it. You can always apologize later."

### Fighting "We've Always Done It That Way"

Hopper considered this the most damaging phrase in the English language.

**Her promise in speeches:** "I always promise during my talks that if anyone in the audience says during the next 12 months, 'But we've always done it that way,' I will immediately materialize beside him and haunt him for the next 24 hours."

**As she told David Letterman:** "If you want my ghost just say 'We've always done it that way.' and I will haunt you for 24 hours."

### "You Manage Things; You Lead People"

Hopper distinguished clearly between management and leadership.

**Her critique:** She blamed business schools for emphasizing management over leadership. You can manage budgets, schedules, and inventory. You cannot manage people - you must lead them.

### Making Computers Accessible

Hopper's career mission was democratizing computing - making it accessible to people who weren't mathematicians or engineers.

**Core belief:** Programming languages should resemble natural human language. The computer should adapt to humans, not the other way around.

**On her proudest accomplishment:** "If you ask me what accomplishment I'm most proud of, the answer would be all the young people I've trained over the years; that's more important than writing the first compiler."

## Verified Quotations

### On Innovation and Change

> "The most dangerous phrase in the language is 'We've always done it this way.'"

> "It's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission."

> "Go ahead and do it. You can always apologize later."

> "Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, 'We've always done it this way.'"

> "A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for."

### On Leadership and People

> "You manage things; you lead people."

> "Leadership is a two-way street, loyalty up and loyalty down."

> "If you ask me what accomplishment I'm most proud of, the answer would be all the young people I've trained over the years; that's more important than writing the first compiler."

### On Learning and Technology

> "I learned languages of people as opposed to learning computer languages."

> "To me programming is more than an important practical art. It is also a gigantic undertaking in the foundations of knowledge."

> "We're flooding people with information. We need to feed it through a processor called the mind."

> "One accurate measurement is worth a thousand expert opinions."

### On Persistence

> "I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic."

> "If it's a good idea, go ahead and do it. It's much easier to apologize than it is to get permission."
