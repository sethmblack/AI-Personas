- **Actionable** - Clear, repeatable steps
- **Invocable** - Could be triggered by request
- **Scoped** - One responsibility, clear boundaries
- **Reusable** - Applies across contexts
- **Valuable** - Saves significant effort

## Skill Candidates

### 1. Cognitive Distortion Identification

**Priority:** HIGH

**Description:** Systematically identify and name cognitive distortions (thinking errors) in a person's automatic thoughts.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- "What's wrong with my thinking?"
- "Why do I always think this way?"
- "I know it's irrational but..."
- When examining negative thought patterns

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Actionable | Yes | Clear list of 10+ distortions with definitions and examples |
| Invocable | Yes | Can be triggered when examining thoughts |
| Scoped | Yes | Only identifies distortions; does not challenge or replace thoughts |
| Reusable | Yes | Applies to any thought content |
| Valuable | Yes | Names patterns that can then be addressed |

**Output:** Named distortion(s) with definition and how it applies to the specific thought

---

### 2. Thought Record Analysis

**Priority:** HIGH

**Description:** Guide someone through the 7-column thought record process to examine and reframe automatic thoughts.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- "Help me work through this thought"
- "I can't stop thinking about..."
- "I know I'm being irrational but I still feel..."
- When someone presents a situation-thought-feeling pattern

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Actionable | Yes | 7 clear columns with specific prompts |
| Invocable | Yes | Can be triggered when examining thoughts |
| Scoped | Yes | Structured tool for one thought at a time |
| Reusable | Yes | Works for any automatic thought |
| Valuable | Yes | Research shows significant symptom reduction |

**Output:** Completed thought record with alternative thought and emotional shift

---

### 3. Cognitive Triad Assessment

**Priority:** HIGH

**Description:** Map depressive thinking patterns across three domains: self, world/others, and future.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- "I feel hopeless"
- "Everything is terrible"
- "I'm worthless"
- When depression symptoms are present
- When negative thinking is pervasive

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Actionable | Yes | Three clear domains with specific examples |
| Invocable | Yes | Triggered by depressive presentation |
| Scoped | Yes | Specifically for depression/low mood |
| Reusable | Yes | Universal framework for depressive thinking |
| Valuable | Yes | Provides structure for treatment planning |

**Output:** Systematic map of negative beliefs in three domains with representative thoughts

---

### 4. Behavioral Experiment Design

**Priority:** HIGH

**Description:** Design a real-world test to gather evidence about a belief, including prediction, experiment, and evaluation framework.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- "I know this thought is probably wrong but I still believe it"
- When verbal challenging is insufficient
- "How do I test if this is true?"
- When a belief persists despite discussion

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Actionable | Yes | 6-step process clearly defined |
| Invocable | Yes | Triggered when thoughts resist verbal challenge |
| Scoped | Yes | One belief, one experiment |
| Reusable | Yes | Works for any testable belief |
| Valuable | Yes | Provides experiential evidence vs. intellectual |

**Output:** Specific experiment design with prediction, procedure, and evaluation plan

---

### 5. Socratic Questioning Sequence

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Description:** Generate a series of guided discovery questions to help someone examine a belief without direct challenge.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- When someone holds a strong negative belief
- "I just know that's true"
- When direct challenge would create resistance
- Facilitating self-discovery

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Actionable | Yes | Clear question patterns and purposes |
| Invocable | Yes | Triggered when guided discovery is needed |
| Scoped | Yes | Only generates questions; does not provide answers |
| Reusable | Yes | Question framework applies to any belief |
| Valuable | Partial | More subtle; requires user engagement |

**Output:** Sequence of 4-6 questions tailored to the specific belief

---

### 6. Automatic Thought Capture

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Description:** Help someone identify the specific automatic thoughts occurring in a situation, particularly those operating below awareness.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- "I just felt terrible but I don't know why"
- "Something triggered me"
- When emotions seem disconnected from situation
- Beginning any cognitive work

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Actionable | Yes | Specific prompts to surface thoughts |
| Invocable | Yes | Triggered by unexplained emotional reactions |
| Scoped | Yes | Only captures thoughts; does not evaluate them |
| Reusable | Yes | Works for any situation-emotion pair |
| Valuable | Partial | Foundational but not standalone |

**Output:** Identified automatic thought(s) with situation and emotional context

---

### 7. Evidence Examination

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Description:** Systematically gather evidence for and against a thought to evaluate its accuracy.

**Trigger Conditions:**
- "Is this thought actually true?"
- "Let's look at the evidence"
- After identifying a distorted thought
- Part of thought record process

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Met? | Evidence |
|-----------|------|----------|
| Actionable | Yes | Two-column format with guiding questions |
| Invocable | Yes | Triggered during thought evaluation |
| Scoped | Yes | Only examines evidence; does not generate alternatives |
| Reusable | Yes | Works for any thought |
| Valuable | Partial | Core but often part of larger process |

**Output:** Evidence for and against the thought in structured format

---

## Prioritization Summary

### HIGH Priority (Implement First)
1. **cognitive-distortion-identification** - Foundational naming tool
2. **thought-record-analysis** - Complete structured intervention
3. **cognitive-triad-assessment** - Depression-specific diagnostic tool
4. **behavioral-experiment-design** - Evidence-gathering for resistant beliefs

### MEDIUM Priority (Consider for Implementation)
5. **socratic-questioning-sequence** - Useful but more specialized
6. **automatic-thought-capture** - Foundational but often integrated
7. **evidence-examination** - Core but usually part of thought record

### LOW Priority (Not Extracted as Standalone)
- Schema identification (more complex, requires schema therapy training)
- Assessment instrument interpretation (copyrighted materials)
- Session structure (too broad)

---

## Recommended Skill Creation Order

1. **cognitive-distortion-identification** - Foundational; other skills reference distortions
2. **thought-record-analysis** - Most complete standalone intervention
3. **cognitive-triad-assessment** - Depression-specific; high clinical value
4. **behavioral-experiment-design** - Extends beyond verbal methods

---

## Notes

- Beck's methodology is highly structured, making it well-suited to skill extraction
- Skills can be used independently or chained (identify distortion → thought record → behavioral experiment)
- Socratic questioning is embedded in Beck's voice and may not need separate skill
- Evidence examination is integrated into thought record; may not need standalone
