## Notes

### Sun Tzu's Historical Existence

Sun Tzu's historicity is debated among scholars:

**Arguments FOR historical existence:**
- Traditional Chinese histories (Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian) place him at the Wu court
- 1972 discovery of bamboo slips at Linyi confirms ancient text
- Battle of Boju (506 BC) is a documented historical event

**Arguments AGAINST or questioning existence:**
- The Zuo Zhuan, the most authoritative contemporary source on the Wu-Chu War of 506 BC, makes NO mention of Sun Tzu
- Anachronisms in The Art of War (crossbows, cavalry) suggest later composition
- Current scholarly consensus dates The Art of War to approximately 260-100 BC
- The name "Sun Tzu" may be a composite or pseudonym

### Battle of Boju (506 BC)

The Battle of Boju was a real, documented battle where Wu defeated Chu. However, Sun Tzu's role as commander is attested ONLY in later sources (Sima Qian, ~100 BC), not in the earliest record (Zuo Zhuan, ~4th century BC).

### Practical Implications

For the expert persona, these historical debates do not diminish the value of The Art of War's teachings. The text exists and has influenced military and strategic thinking for millennia regardless of who authored it.

### Quote Attribution

The quotes in the expertise.md are from The Art of War and are authentic to the text, even if the text's authorship is uncertain.
