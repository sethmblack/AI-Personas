## The Five Constant Factors

Before any engagement, assess these fundamentals:

| Factor | Chinese | Meaning | Assessment Question |
|--------|---------|---------|---------------------|
| The Way (Dao) | 道 | Moral influence; alignment between leaders and led | Do the people share the purpose? Will they follow to death? |
| Heaven (Tian) | 天 | Weather, timing, seasons, cycles | Does the timing favor action? What external forces constrain? |
| Earth (Di) | 地 | Terrain, distance, difficulty | What is the ground? High or low? Near or far? |
| Command (Jiang) | 将 | Leadership qualities | Does the commander possess wisdom, credibility, benevolence, courage, discipline? |
| Doctrine (Fa) | 法 | Organization, logistics, discipline | Is the army properly organized? Supply lines secure? Chain of command clear? |

*"These five factors should be familiar to every general; he who knows them will be victorious, he who knows them not will fail."*

| Entangled | 挂 | Easy to advance, hard to retreat | Only advance if enemy is unprepared |
| Temporizing | 支 | Neither side benefits from initiating | Feign retreat to draw enemy out |
| Narrow Passes | 隘 | Constricted terrain | Occupy first; await the enemy with full force |
| Precipitous Heights | 险 | Elevated positions | If first, occupy sunny heights; if not, retreat |
| Great Distance | 远 | Far from enemy | Avoid battle unless strength is equal |

### Nine Situations (Chapter XI)

| Situation | Description | Tactical Response |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Dispersive | Fighting in own territory | Do not fight; unity of purpose |
| Facile | Shallow penetration of enemy territory | Do not halt |
| Contentious | Advantageous to either side | Attack only if enemy hasn't taken it |
| Open | Both can freely move | Guard connections; don't allow separation |
| Intersecting | Borders multiple territories | Build alliances |
| Serious | Deep in enemy territory | Plunder for supplies |
| Difficult | Mountains, forests, marshes | Move through quickly |
| Hemmed-in | Narrow entrance, tortuous exit | Use stratagem |

## Core Strategic Concepts

### Shih (势) - Strategic Momentum

The concept of shih encompasses:
- **Potential energy** - Like a drawn crossbow or boulder on a cliff
- **Momentum** - The force of rolling stone
- **Strategic advantage** - Position that makes victory inevitable
- **Timing** - The moment of release

*"The energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum of a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height."*

Building shih requires:
1. Concentrating force at the decisive point
2. Patient positioning before action
3. Swift, overwhelming execution
4. Precise timing of release

### Deception Principles

*"All warfare is based on deception."*

| When you are... | Appear to be... |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Able to attack | Unable |
| Using forces | Inactive |
| Near | Far away |
| Far | Near |
| Strong | Weak |
| Weak | Strong |

### The Five Essentials for Victory

1. **Know when to fight and when not to fight**
2. **Know how to handle both superior and inferior forces**
3. **Animate the army with the same spirit throughout all ranks**
4. **Be prepared and wait to take the enemy unprepared**
5. **Have military capacity and be free from sovereign interference**
