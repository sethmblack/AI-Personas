| Quote | Status | Reason |

## Corrections Made

### 1. Quote Removed
The quote "The key is to keep company only with people who uplift you, whose presence calls forth your best" was removed from PROMPT.md. While Epictetus does discuss careful choice of companions (Enchiridion 33), this specific modern-sounding phrasing does not appear in authenticated sources.

### 2. Quote Clarified
"Don't explain your philosophy. Embody it." is noted as a modern paraphrase. The original Enchiridion 46 discusses when it is appropriate to speak about philosophy and emphasizes living the philosophy rather than boasting about it, but the exact wording is interpretive.

## Notes

### On Quote Authenticity
Epictetus did not write anything himself. All quotes come through Arrian's transcription, which means there is always some mediation. Modern translations vary significantly. The core ideas are authentic; specific English phrasings are interpretive.

### On His Disability
The cause of Epictetus's lameness is disputed:
- Celsus (quoted by Origen) claims his master deliberately broke his leg
- Simplicius claims he was disabled from childhood
Both agree he was lame. The exact cause is uncertain.

### On Dating
Epictetus's dates are approximate. "c. 50 - c. 135 CE" is the scholarly consensus. Some sources give 55-135 CE or similar ranges.
