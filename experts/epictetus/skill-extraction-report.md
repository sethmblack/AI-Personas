# Skill Extraction Report: Epictetus

## Extraction Methodology

Skills are evaluated on 5 criteria, each worth 10 points (max 50):

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Actionable** | Can be executed as a clear procedure with defined steps |
| **Invocable** | Has natural trigger phrases users would say |
| **Scoped** | Well-bounded problem space with clear inputs/outputs |
| **Reusable** | Applicable across many contexts and situations |
| **Valuable** | Provides genuine insight or transformation |

**Priority Thresholds:**
- **HIGH** (40-50 points): Create standalone skill prompt
- **MEDIUM** (30-39 points): Include in persona, consider for expansion
- **LOW** (20-29 points): Mention only, not worth standalone extraction

## Extracted Skills

### 1. The Dichotomy of Control (Eph' Hemin Analysis)

**Description:** Rigorously separate any situation into what is "up to us" (prohairesis) versus what is "not up to us," to focus energy and eliminate suffering from attachment to externals.

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear two-category framework with explicit sorting process |
| Invocable | 10 | Natural triggers: "What can I control?" "I'm overwhelmed" "What is up to me?" |
| Scoped | 10 | Well-defined: input situation, output sorted categories + action focus |
| Reusable | 10 | Universal—applies to any stressful situation, decision, or anxiety |
| Valuable | 10 | Foundation of Stoic practice; influences CBT; directly addresses suffering |

**Total: 50/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

*Note: While Marcus Aurelius also teaches this, Epictetus is the original source and most rigorous formulation. Consider linking to existing dichotomy-of-control skill or creating Epictetus-specific variant.*

### 2. Handling Impressions (Phantasia Management)

**Description:** Pause before reacting to any impression; examine whether it concerns things up to us; withhold assent from disturbing judgments until they are tested by reason.

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear 5-step process: pause, examine, ask, decide, respond |
| Invocable | 10 | Natural triggers: "Why am I so upset?" "I can't stop thinking about X" "This is unbearable" |
| Scoped | 10 | Focused on managing mental impressions and emotional reactions |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to any strong emotion, disturbing thought, or reaction |
| Valuable | 10 | Core technique underlying CBT; directly transforms suffering at its source |

**Total: 50/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 3. The Role Check (Persona Doctrine)

**Description:** Identify your roles in any situation, determine what each role requires, and perform your function excellently regardless of outcome.

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear framework: identify roles, determine duties, perform excellently |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers: "What should I do?" "What's my duty?" "I'm torn between obligations" |
| Scoped | 9 | Well-bounded: ethical decision-making based on roles and duties |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to any ethical dilemma, professional situation, or relationship conflict |
| Valuable | 9 | Provides clarity when duties conflict; reduces outcome-attachment |

**Total: 46/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 4. The Discipline of Desire (Orexis Training)

**Description:** Train desire toward what is truly up to us (virtue, character) and away from externals (wealth, reputation, outcomes) that can never be fully controlled.

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Framework for examining and redirecting desires; requires ongoing practice |
| Invocable | 8 | Natural triggers: "I want X so badly" "I'm afraid of Y" "I keep craving Z" |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused on desire/aversion but somewhat abstract |
| Reusable | 10 | Universal—addresses core human tendency toward attachment |
| Valuable | 9 | Transforms relationship with wanting; reduces frustration and anxiety |

**Total: 43/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 5. Fate Acceptance Practice (Proto-Amor Fati)

**Description:** Accept what happens as part of the universal order; find the virtue each situation demands rather than wishing things were different.

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Framework for reframing adversity; asks "what virtue does this call forth?" |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural triggers: "Why is this happening to me?" "This is unfair" "I didn't deserve this" |
| Scoped | 8 | Addresses response to adversity and misfortune |
| Reusable | 10 | Universal—everyone faces adversity and misfortune |
| Valuable | 9 | Transforms suffering into opportunity; aligns with research on post-traumatic growth |

**Total: 44/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 6. The Three Disciplines Framework

**Description:** Organize Stoic practice into three areas: desire (what to want), action (how to behave), and assent (what to believe).

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Meta-framework more than specific practice |
| Invocable | 6 | Less natural trigger—people don't ask "help me with the three disciplines" |
| Scoped | 7 | Comprehensive but abstract |
| Reusable | 8 | Organizes all Stoic practice |
| Valuable | 8 | Useful for understanding Stoic curriculum |

**Total: 36/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Description:** Use questioning to expose contradictions in one's own beliefs and discover where attachment to externals persists.

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | More method than procedure |
| Invocable | 6 | Less obvious triggers |
| Scoped | 7 | Overlaps with Socrates persona |
| Reusable | 8 | Valuable for self-knowledge |
| Valuable | 8 | Epictetus was influenced by Socratic method |

**Total: 36/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

## Skills to Create

1. **handling-impressions/** - Core technique for managing emotional reactions (Phantasia Management)
2. **role-check/** - Identify roles and duties in any situation
3. **discipline-of-desire/** - Train desire toward what is up to us
4. **fate-acceptance/** - Accept what happens and find the virtue it demands

*Note: The dichotomy-of-control skill already exists and can be referenced/linked. Epictetus is its original source.*

## Skill Relationships

```
dichotomy-of-control (foundation)
        │
        ├── handling-impressions (applies dichotomy to mental events)
        │
        ├── discipline-of-desire (applies dichotomy to wants/fears)
        │
        └── role-check (action within what's up to us)
                │
                └── fate-acceptance (accepting what's not up to us)
```

The dichotomy of control is foundational. All other skills flow from the distinction between what is and is not "up to us."
