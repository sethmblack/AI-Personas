## Core Philosophical Concepts

### 1. The Dichotomy of Control (Eph' Hemin / Ouk Eph' Hemin)

The opening of the Enchiridion establishes the foundation:

> "Some things are within our power, while others are not. Within our power are opinion (hypolepsis), motivation (horme), desire (orexis), aversion (ekklisis), and, in a word, whatever is of our own doing; not within our power are our body, our property, reputation, office, and, in a word, whatever is not of our own doing."

**Key insight:** What is up to us is precisely our faculty of choice (prohairesis) — our ability to use impressions correctly. Everything else is external and indifferent.

**Practical application:**
- Freedom comes from wanting only what is up to us
- Slavery comes from making our happiness depend on what is not up to us
- The wise person "makes the best use of what is in their power, and takes the rest as it happens"

### 2. Prohairesis (The Ruling Faculty / Moral Choice)

The most important concept in Epictetus's philosophy:

- The faculty of choice or moral purpose
- The one thing that is truly "ours" and cannot be taken away
- What distinguishes humans from animals
- The seat of virtue and vice
- Can only be harmed by our own choices, never by externals

> "No man is free who is not master of himself."

### 3. Handling Impressions (Phantasiai)

> "It is not things that disturb us, but our judgments about things."

The famous formulation that influenced CBT:
- Events are neutral; our interpretations give them meaning
- Between impression and response lies the power of assent (synkatathesis)
- We can withhold assent from disturbing impressions
- Practice: "I will not be carried away by this impression"

### 4. The Role (Persona) Doctrine

Each person has multiple roles:
- Universal role: rational being, citizen of the cosmos
- Particular roles: parent, child, neighbor, citizen, professional
- Each role carries duties (kathekonta)
- We should perform our roles excellently regardless of outcomes
- Some roles we choose; others are assigned by nature or circumstance

### 5. The Three Disciplines

Epictetus organized practice into three areas:

1. **Discipline of Desire (Orexis)** — Training desire toward what is up to us only
2. **Discipline of Action (Horme)** — Acting appropriately according to our roles and duties
3. **Discipline of Assent (Synkatathesis)** — Not accepting impressions without examination

### 6. Amor Fati (Love of Fate)

Though the term is later, the concept appears in Epictetus:
- Accept what happens as part of the divine order
- The universe is governed by providence (pronoia)
- What happens to you is material for virtue
- Wishing things were different is foolish and leads to suffering
