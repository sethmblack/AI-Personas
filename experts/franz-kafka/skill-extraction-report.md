## Skill Candidates Identified

### HIGH PRIORITY

#### 1. Kafkaesque Situation Analyzer
**Description:** Analyzes situations, systems, or narratives for Kafkaesque qualities using Kafka's frameworks.

**Triggers:**
- "Is this Kafkaesque?"
- "Analyze this bureaucracy"
- "Why does this feel like a nightmare?"
- Descriptions of frustrating systems, circular logic, or impersonal authority

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear framework: invisible authority, unknowable rules, guilt without crime, no escape |
| Invocable | 10 | Easily triggered by system analysis requests |
| Scoped | 9 | Focused on identifying Kafkaesque patterns |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to bureaucracy, tech systems, workplace, healthcare, legal systems |
| Valuable | 10 | Provides structured analysis of abstract frustration |

**Total: 49/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Methodology from expertise.md:**
- Is there an authority that cannot be reached or appealed to?
- Are the rules known only after they are broken?
- Does the protagonist's reasonable response make things worse?
- Is guilt assumed rather than proven?
- Does the system continue regardless of individual suffering?
- Is escape impossible not because of walls but because of procedure?

#### 2. Matter-of-Fact Impossible Writer
**Description:** Transforms ideas into prose that presents the absurd with clinical detachment, using Kafka's signature technique.

**Triggers:**
- "Write this in Kafka's style"
- "Make this surreal but matter-of-fact"
- "Describe the impossible as normal"
- Creative writing involving absurdity or transformation

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear technique: state absurd as fact, focus on practical details, long sentences |
| Invocable | 10 | Triggered by style requests |
| Scoped | 9 | Focused on prose generation |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to fiction, scenario writing, thought experiments |
| Valuable | 9 | Distinctive technique not easily replicated |

**Total: 47/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Methodology from expertise.md:**
- Begin in medias res with the impossible
- State the absurd as fact; explain nothing
- Accumulate precise detail (exact times, furniture, job titles)
- Use long sentences with subordinate clauses
- Focus on practical concerns after stating the impossible
- Withhold resolution
- Find the comedy in the tragedy

#### 3. Bureaucratic Nightmare Decoder
**Description:** Decodes and explains how bureaucratic systems operate to frustrate, using *The Trial* and *The Castle* frameworks.

**Triggers:**
- "Why can't I get through to anyone?"
- "This system makes no sense"
- "I'm stuck in an endless loop"
- Descriptions of procedure, red tape, circular referrals

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear framework: invisible authority, infinite deferral, rules known only after broken |
| Invocable | 10 | Triggered by bureaucratic frustration |
| Scoped | 9 | Focused on explaining bureaucratic dysfunction |
| Reusable | 10 | Healthcare, government, corporate, legal, tech support |
| Valuable | 10 | Names and explains previously inarticulate frustration |

**Total: 49/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Methodology from expertise.md:**
- The goal is visible but the path is obscured
- Each intermediary refers to another intermediary
- Persistence is interpreted as aggression
- Waiting is both required and punished
- Success would mean discovering the system is empty
- Power operates invisibly through procedure
- Defense implies guilt
- The process is the punishment

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 4. Alienation Analyst
**Description:** Analyzes experiences of alienation using *The Metamorphosis* framework.

**Triggers:**
- "I feel like an outsider"
- "I don't belong"
- "Analyze this alienation"
- Descriptions of exclusion, transformation, loss of identity

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9 | Framework: what has changed, how does system adapt, what labor was provided |
| Invocable | 8 | Less commonly triggered than bureaucracy |
| Scoped | 8 | Some overlap with general psychology |
| Reusable | 9 | Workplace, family, social situations |
| Valuable | 8 | Useful lens but more specialized |

**Total: 42/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Methodology from expertise.md:**
- What has the protagonist become that they always were?
- How does the family/system maintain itself despite the change?
- What labor was the transformed person providing?
- How does the transformation reveal the truth of the previous state?
- When does care become burden become disgust?

**Criteria Assessment:**
| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 8 | Framework provides understanding but limited practical solutions |
| Invocable | 9 | Triggered by authority access problems |
| Scoped | 8 | Significant overlap with Bureaucratic Nightmare Decoder |
| Reusable | 9 | Corporate, government, institutional contexts |
| Valuable | 8 | Understanding helps but doesn't always solve |

**Total: 42/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

### LOW PRIORITY (Not Recommended for Extraction)

#### 6. Father-Son Conflict Analyzer
**Reason for Low Priority:** Too personal/psychological; overlaps with general therapy frameworks; limited application outside literary analysis.

#### 7. Kafka Quote Verifier
**Reason for Low Priority:** Reference task better suited to expertise.md consultation; not a methodology.
