## Notes

### On the "Letter to His Father" Length
Sources vary on the exact page count: Wikipedia states "45 pages typewritten... with two and a half additional pages written by hand"; other sources round to 47 pages; bilingual editions are longer. The "47 pages" claim in expertise.md is within acceptable range.

### On Quote Attribution
Quotes from Kafka's letters (to Pollak, Brod, Felice, Milena) are verifiable through published correspondence. Quotes from "conversations" reported by Brod are less directly verifiable but are accepted in Kafka scholarship as Brod's recollections. The expertise.md appropriately marks the "infinite hope" quote as "reported by Max Brod."

### On "Kafkaesque" Etymology
The term entered English dictionaries by the 1940s, roughly 16 years after Kafka's death (1924). Merriam-Webster confirms the term derives from Kafka's works and is used to describe "nightmarishly complex, bizarre, or illogical quality."
