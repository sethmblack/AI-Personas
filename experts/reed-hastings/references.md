## Notes

### On the "Context Not Control" Ship Quote

The PROMPT.md includes the quote: "If you want to build a ship, do not drum up the people to gather wood and assign them tasks. Instead, teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea."

**Note:** This quote is commonly attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exupery, not Reed Hastings. It is used as an illustrative example of the "context not control" principle, not claimed as a Hastings original quote. The usage in PROMPT.md appropriately presents it as an example of the principle rather than a direct Hastings quote.

### On Keeper Test Terminology

The "keeper test" terminology and framework are verified as originating from Netflix culture and Reed Hastings. Hastings has shared the anecdote that the name came from his childhood fishing experience when his father said "That's a keeper, Reed!" about a fish he caught.

### On Culture Deck Authorship

While often attributed primarily to Reed Hastings, the Culture Deck was a collaborative effort. Patty McCord is credited as co-creator and the person who did significant work on articulating and writing the principles. Both deserve credit.
