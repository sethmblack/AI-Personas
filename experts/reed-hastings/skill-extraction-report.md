## HIGH Priority

### 1. keeper-test-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Keeper Test (The Talent Density Framework)
**Purpose:** Evaluate individual team members or entire teams against the keeper test to identify talent density issues and make clear recommendations
**Trigger:** "Should we keep this person?", "Evaluate my team", "Talent density assessment", "Performance review", "Would I fight to keep them?"
**Inputs:** Description of person/team, their performance, their behaviors, context about their role
**Outputs:** Keeper test evaluation with clear yes/no determination, specific reasoning, recommended actions (generous severance or investment areas)
**Reasoning:** Clear 4-step actionable process (hire rock stars, apply keeper test, generous severance, no brilliant jerks). Used frequently in team composition decisions. Saves 30+ minutes of deliberation by providing structured framework. Maps directly to core Hastings methodology.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear steps and binary decision outcome
- Invocable: YES - "Apply the keeper test to this team member"
- Scoped: YES - One responsibility (talent evaluation)
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any team member evaluation
- Valuable: YES - Saves significant deliberation time, ensures consistent standards

### 2. freedom-responsibility-calibration

**Source Pattern:** Freedom and Responsibility Framework
**Purpose:** Diagnose whether an organization or team has the right balance of freedom and structure, given their talent density
**Trigger:** "Should we remove this policy?", "Do we have too many rules?", "Calibrate freedom vs. control", "Freedom and responsibility assessment"
**Inputs:** Current policies/rules, talent density assessment, recent incidents of policy abuse or gaps
**Outputs:** Calibration report with recommendations to add/remove structure based on talent density level
**Reasoning:** Implementation ladder is clear (4 steps). High reuse across organizational design questions. Saves significant time versus ad-hoc policy discussions. Directly addresses common management dilemma.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 4-step implementation ladder
- Invocable: YES - "Assess our freedom vs. responsibility balance"
- Scoped: YES - One responsibility (policy calibration)
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any org/team structure decision
- Valuable: YES - Prevents both chaos (too much freedom) and bureaucracy (too much control)

### 3. 4a-feedback-delivery

**Source Pattern:** The 4A Feedback Model
**Purpose:** Structure and deliver difficult feedback using the 4A model (Aim to assist, Actionable, Appreciate, Accept/decline)
**Trigger:** "Help me give feedback", "How do I tell them...", "Feedback conversation", "4A feedback", "Radical candor"
**Inputs:** The feedback to deliver, context about the person and situation
**Outputs:** Scripted feedback delivery with all 4As addressed, anti-patterns avoided
**Reasoning:** Clear 4-step structure for both giving and receiving. High frequency use case (feedback happens constantly). Anti-patterns clearly documented. Transforms vague "be more direct" into actionable script.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 4 explicit steps with anti-patterns
- Invocable: YES - "Script this feedback using 4A model"
- Scoped: YES - Single feedback conversation
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any feedback situation
- Valuable: YES - Transforms difficult conversations into structured interactions

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. context-not-control-setup

**Source Pattern:** Context Not Control Framework
**Purpose:** Convert a control-based management situation into a context-based one by providing the right information for autonomous decision-making
**Trigger:** "How do I delegate this?", "They keep asking for approval", "Context not control", "Empower them to decide"
**Inputs:** The decision to be delegated, current approval process, information available to decision-maker
**Outputs:** Context package (6-item checklist) that enables autonomous decision-making
**Reasoning:** Clear 6-item checklist structure. Common management challenge. Overlap (~40%) with freedom-responsibility-calibration but focuses on specific decisions rather than org-wide policy.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 6-item context checklist
- Invocable: YES - "Set up context for this decision"
- Scoped: YES - Single decision delegation
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any decision delegation
- Valuable: YES - Enables faster, better decisions at lower levels

### 5. sunshining-session

**Source Pattern:** Sunshining Practice
**Purpose:** Prepare and facilitate a leadership vulnerability session where leaders share their mistakes openly
**Trigger:** "Build psychological safety", "Leaders sharing mistakes", "Sunshine my errors", "Create trust"
**Inputs:** Recent mistakes/failures to share, audience context, team trust level
**Outputs:** Structured sunshining presentation, facilitation guide, follow-up actions
**Reasoning:** Clear implementation steps (all-hands format, post-mortems, regular practice). Saves preparation time for leaders. Creates consistent format across organization.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear implementation steps
- Invocable: YES - "Prepare a sunshining session"
- Scoped: YES - Single trust-building session
- Reusable: YES - Regular practice, applies to any leader
- Valuable: MEDIUM - Saves 15-20 minutes prep, less frequent than feedback

### 6. talent-density-diagnostic

**Source Pattern:** Metrics and Indicators (Signs of Healthy Talent Density)
**Purpose:** Assess an organization's talent density health using observable metrics and indicators
**Trigger:** "How's our talent density?", "Team health assessment", "Are we hiring well?", "Talent diagnostic"
**Inputs:** Team composition, turnover data, hiring velocity, performance action rate
**Outputs:** Talent density scorecard with specific indicators and improvement recommendations
**Reasoning:** Clear metrics provided in expertise (4 indicators per category). Enables regular organizational health checks. Overlap (~50%) with keeper-test-assessment but focuses on aggregate rather than individual.

**5-Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Specific metrics to check
- Invocable: YES - "Run a talent density diagnostic"
- Scoped: YES - Organizational assessment
- Reusable: YES - Quarterly/annual check
- Valuable: MEDIUM - Less frequent use, higher-level strategic tool
