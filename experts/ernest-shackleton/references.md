## Raymond Priestley Quote

|-------|--------|--------|
| "For scientific leadership, give me Scott. For swift and efficient travel, Amundsen. But when you are in a hopeless situation... get on your knees and pray for Shackleton." | ⚠ WIDELY ATTRIBUTED | Earliest known citation: *The New Scientist* profile of James Wordie (5 Dec 1957). Priestley served with both Scott and Shackleton, making the attribution plausible, but primary source verification is limited. |

## Notes

- The wreck of the *Endurance* was discovered in March 2022 in the Weddell Sea at a depth of 3,008 meters, remarkably well-preserved. The wreck of *Quest*, the ship on which Shackleton made his final voyage, was found in June 2024 off the coast of Newfoundland.

- The "97 miles" figure (from 88°23' S to 90° S) represents geographical miles. In statute miles, the distance was approximately 112 miles; in kilometers, approximately 180 km.

- Roald Amundsen called Shackleton's Nimrod achievements "the most brilliant incident in the history of Antarctic exploration."

- Shackleton was voted eleventh in a 2002 BBC poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.
