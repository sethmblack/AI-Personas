## HIGH Priority

### 1. crisis-mission-pivot

**Source Pattern:** People Over Mission / The Mission Pivot
**Purpose:** When circumstances make the original mission impossible, help leaders redefine success around what truly matters—typically people, survival, and core values.
**Trigger:** "My plan has failed completely" or "How do I pivot in crisis?" or "Everything has changed—what now?"
**Inputs:** Description of failed situation, original objectives, current resources, who is affected
**Outputs:** Reframed mission statement, immediate priorities, communication strategy for the pivot, morale considerations
**Reasoning:** Shackleton's most distinctive leadership moment—the instant pivot from "cross Antarctica" to "bring everyone home." This is a complete, actionable framework for the hardest moment any leader faces: admitting the original plan is dead while maintaining forward momentum.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - 4-step process: acknowledge, reframe, communicate, act
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases around crisis and failure
- Scoped: YES - specifically about pivoting from failed to new mission
- Reusable: YES - applies to startups, projects, careers, organizations
- Valuable: YES - addresses universal crisis moment with clear methodology

**Score: 48/50**

### 2. team-morale-crisis

**Source Pattern:** Optimism as Survival Tool / The Optimism Injection
**Purpose:** Maintain and rebuild team morale during extended periods of hardship, uncertainty, or organizational crisis.
**Trigger:** "Team morale is collapsing" or "How do I keep spirits up?" or "My people are demoralized"
**Inputs:** Description of team situation, duration of crisis, current morale indicators, available resources
**Outputs:** Immediate morale interventions, celebration opportunities, routine recommendations, leader behavior prescriptions
**Reasoning:** Shackleton's deliberate morale management over 22 months is one of history's best case studies. This skill captures his methodology: routine, celebration, future focus, and concealed leader anxiety. Highly applicable to any extended difficult period.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific interventions and leader behaviors
- Invocable: YES - common phrases around team morale
- Scoped: YES - focused on morale during crisis
- Reusable: YES - startups, turnarounds, difficult projects, layoffs
- Valuable: YES - morale is often the difference between survival and collapse

**Score: 46/50**

### 3. troublemaker-management

**Source Pattern:** The Troublemaker Tent
**Purpose:** Manage individuals who threaten team cohesion without alienating them or losing their contributions.
**Trigger:** "I have a toxic team member" or "How do I handle a difficult personality?" or "This person is hurting morale"
**Inputs:** Description of difficult individual, their skills/value, their negative behaviors, team impact
**Outputs:** Proximity strategy, role recommendations, monitoring approach, potential outcomes assessment
**Reasoning:** Shackleton's counter-intuitive approach—keep troublemakers closest to you—is a distinctive, actionable framework. It prevents the common mistake of isolation, which creates factions. This is reusable across any team situation.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear proximity principle with implementation guidance
- Invocable: YES - common trigger phrases around difficult team members
- Scoped: YES - specifically about managing difficult individuals
- Reusable: YES - universal team management challenge

**Score: 45/50**

### 4. crisis-decision-framework

**Source Pattern:** The Calculated Risk / Key Decisions That Saved the Crew
**Purpose:** Make high-stakes decisions when waiting is dangerous but action is also risky. Determine when bold action is necessary and how to commit fully.
**Trigger:** "Should I act now or wait?" or "This is a huge risk but..." or "Help me decide whether to take this chance"
**Inputs:** Current situation, risk of waiting, risk of action, resources available, who is affected
**Outputs:** Action/wait recommendation, preparation checklist, commitment strategy, contingency considerations
**Reasoning:** The James Caird voyage decision exemplifies this: 800 miles in a 22-foot boat is madness—unless the alternative is certain death. This framework helps distinguish calculated boldness from recklessness and from paralysis.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - decision criteria and preparation steps
- Invocable: YES - common phrases around risk decisions
- Scoped: YES - specifically about when to act vs. wait in crisis
- Reusable: YES - business pivots, career changes, difficult timing decisions
- Valuable: YES - prevents both recklessness and paralysis

## MEDIUM Priority

### 5. servant-leadership-audit

**Source Pattern:** Servant Leadership / The Servant's Priority
**Purpose:** Assess and improve leadership behavior through the lens of service to the team.
**Trigger:** "Am I being a good leader?" or "How do I show my team I care?" or "Evaluate my leadership"
**Inputs:** Description of leadership behaviors, team situation, recent decisions
**Outputs:** Servant leadership scorecard, improvement recommendations, immediate actions to demonstrate service
**Reasoning:** Shackleton's "leaders eat last" approach is a powerful model. This skill operationalizes it as an audit framework. Less crisis-specific than the HIGH priority skills but broadly applicable.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - scorecard with specific behaviors
- Invocable: YES - leadership evaluation phrases
- Scoped: YES - servant leadership specifically

**Score: 38/50**

### 6. crisis-crew-selection

**Source Pattern:** Crew Selection Philosophy / Selecting the James Caird Crew
**Purpose:** Select team members for high-stakes, high-pressure situations based on character and fit, not just skills.
**Trigger:** "Who should I bring on this difficult project?" or "How do I build a team for crisis?" or "What should I look for in hires?"
**Inputs:** Nature of the challenge, available candidates, required skills, team dynamics needed
**Outputs:** Selection criteria prioritization, interview approach, team composition recommendations
**Reasoning:** Shackleton's selection process—character over credentials, the singing question, balancing personalities—is distinctive and applicable. Useful for startups, turnaround teams, and critical projects.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - selection criteria and interview techniques
- Invocable: YES - hiring/selection trigger phrases
- Scoped: YES - team selection for difficult situations
- Reusable: YES - hiring decisions, project staffing

### 7. hope-generation-protocol

**Source Pattern:** Future Focus / The Optimism Injection (future-oriented element)
**Purpose:** Create forward-looking hope when current circumstances offer none.
**Trigger:** "How do I give people something to look forward to?" or "The present is terrible—how do I create hope?"
**Inputs:** Current difficult situation, team state, available resources, any genuine future possibilities
**Outputs:** Future vision to share, activities that create anticipation, hope-building conversations
**Reasoning:** Planning "future expeditions to Alaska" while stranded on ice was deliberate hope-creation. This is a specific technique within the broader morale framework—creating future focus when the present is unbearable.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific activities and conversations
- Invocable: YES - hope and future trigger phrases
- Scoped: YES - specifically about creating future orientation
