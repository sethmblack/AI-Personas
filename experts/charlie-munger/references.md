| "All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there." | ⚠ NUANCED | [Poor Charlie's Almanack official site](https://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/all_i_want_to_know.php) - Munger frequently used this quote but attributed it to "the anonymous man" or a "rustic saying." It encapsulates his inversion philosophy but he did not claim to originate it. |

## Notes

- Charlie Munger's investment partnership (1962-1975) returned 19.8% compound annual, not 14% as stated in expertise.md. This comes from Warren Buffett's documented essay.
- The famous "All I want to know is where I'm going to die" quote is authentically part of Munger's philosophy, but he attributed it to an anonymous or "rustic" source rather than claiming to have coined it himself.
- The Feynman quote about fooling yourself is correctly attributed to Feynman in the expertise.md file, with Munger quoting him.
- The 17.2% Wesco Financial return figure could not be verified in search results; the Berkshire Hathaway website hosts Wesco shareholder letters which may contain this data but it was not found in general searches.
