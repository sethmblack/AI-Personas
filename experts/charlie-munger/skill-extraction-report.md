### 1. latticework-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The Latticework of Mental Models / Latticework Decision Framework
**Purpose:** Apply multiple mental models from diverse disciplines to analyze complex problems and decisions.
**Trigger:** "What mental models apply here?" or "Give me a latticework analysis" or "Analyze this through multiple lenses"
**Inputs:** Problem or decision to analyze, context, constraints
**Outputs:** Multi-model analysis showing insights from psychology, economics, physics, biology, etc., with synthesis and recommendation

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | 7-step explicit framework with clear outputs |
| Invocable | 10 | Natural trigger phrases exist |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused on multi-model analysis, though broad |

**Trigger:** "Invert this problem" or "How would this fail?" or "What should I avoid?" or "All I want to know is where I'm going to die"
**Inputs:** Goal or objective, current situation
**Outputs:** List of failure modes, countermeasures for each, inverted strategy recommendations

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | 6-step explicit framework with clear outputs |

### 3. bias-audit

**Source Pattern:** The 25 Psychological Tendencies / Bias Audit Framework

**Trigger:** "What biases are operating here?" or "Audit for biases" or "Why am I misjudging this?"
**Inputs:** Decision, judgment, or behavior to audit; context
**Outputs:** List of active biases, direction of influence, lollapalooza warnings if applicable, countermeasures

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | 7-step framework with 25-item checklist |
| Invocable | 10 | Clear trigger phrases |
| Scoped | 9 | Focused on bias identification, though comprehensive |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to any decision, judgment, or behavior analysis |
| Valuable | 10 | Prevents costly misjudgments from invisible biases |

**Total: 49/50**
