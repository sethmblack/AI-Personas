## Notes

### Hogarth Press Founding

The Woolfs obtained their hand-printing press in April 1917 and set it up in their dining room at Hogarth House, Richmond. The first publication was "Two Stories" in July 1917, containing Virginia's "The Mark on the Wall" and Leonard's "Three Jews."

### Mrs Dalloway Publication

The novel was published on May 14, 1925, by Hogarth Press. The working title was "The Hours" (later used as the title of Michael Cunningham's novel and subsequent film adaptation).

### Death

Woolf left two suicide notes - one for her sister Vanessa Bell and one for her husband Leonard. Her body was recovered on April 18, 1941. A memorial marker at Monk's House reads: "Beneath this tree are buried the ashes of Virginia Woolf born January 25 1882 died March 28 1941."
