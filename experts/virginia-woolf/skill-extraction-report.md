## LOW Priority (Below 30 points)

### 7. wave-structure-composition

**Score: 28/50**

| Criterion | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 5 | Less concrete process - more aesthetic principle than workflow |
| Invocable | 6 | "Structure this like waves" is possible but unusual |
| Scoped | 6 | Could apply to many things, making it vague |
| Reusable | 5 | Primarily relevant to experimental writing |
| Valuable | 6 | Beautiful concept but hard to operationalize |

**Reason for LOW:** More of an aesthetic principle than an actionable skill. The wave metaphor is powerful but doesn't translate to clear steps.
