## Key Works

### Mrs Dalloway (1925)
A single day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, an English aristocrat preparing for an evening party. The novel moves fluidly between characters' consciousnesses, exploring themes of mental illness, time, death, and social expectation.

**Core techniques:**
- Stream of consciousness narration
- Interior monologue and free indirect style
- "Tunneling" - digging caves behind characters to connect present to past
- Big Ben as structural device, marking external time against internal duration

**Key themes:**
- The shell of social performance vs. inner life
- Mental illness and trauma (Septimus Warren Smith)
- Women's constrained lives in post-WWI society
- The fear of death and the embrace of life

### To the Lighthouse (1927)
The Ramsay family's visits to the Isle of Skye, structured in three parts: "The Window" (a single afternoon), "Time Passes" (ten years compressed into a brief middle section), and "The Lighthouse" (the postponed journey completed).

**Core techniques:**
- Multiple focalisation - shifting perspectives without clear demarcation
- Lyrical prose that blurs the boundary between consciousness and narration
- Time's distortion: an afternoon expands while a decade contracts
- Symbolism: the lighthouse as truth, art, the thing sought

**Key themes:**
- The relationship between art and life (Lily Briscoe's painting)
- Marriage, gender roles, and domestic labor
- The passage of time and mortality
- Memory's preservation against loss

### Orlando: A Biography (1928)
A fantastical biography following Orlando from the Elizabethan era to the present day, changing sex midway through. Written for and inspired by Vita Sackville-West.

**Core techniques:**
- Genre subversion - mock biography becomes philosophical exploration
- Satire of biographical convention
- Gender fluidity as narrative device

**Key themes:**
- The fluidity of gender identity
- The relationship between writer and subject
- How identity persists through change
- Literary history and women's exclusion from it

### The Waves (1931)
Six voices in dramatic soliloquy, from childhood to old age, punctuated by interludes describing a seascape from dawn to dusk. Woolf's most experimental work.

**Core techniques:**
- Dramatic soliloquies rather than conventional narration
- Interludes as structural rhythm
- Prose approaching poetry
- Characters as facets of consciousness rather than separate individuals

**Key themes:**
- Individual identity vs. collective being
- The passage of time and mortality
- Language's struggle to capture experience
- Friendship, loss, and memory

### A Room of One's Own (1929)
Extended essay based on lectures at Newnham and Girton colleges, Cambridge. Foundational text of feminist literary criticism.

**Central argument:** "A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction."

**Key concepts:**
- Shakespeare's sister (Judith) - thought experiment about female genius thwarted
- Women as "looking glasses" reflecting men at twice their natural size
- "Anon" was often a woman - female contributions erased from literary history
- The androgynous mind as creative ideal

**Key quotes:**
- "Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind."
- "Women have served all these centuries as looking glasses possessing the magic and delicious power of reflecting the figure of man at twice its natural size."
- "No need to hurry. No need to sparkle. No need to be anybody but oneself."

### Three Guineas (1938)
Essay connecting women's exclusion from public life to militarism and fascism. More explicitly political than *A Room of One's Own*.

**Key arguments:**
- Women as "Outsiders' Society" - excluded from professions, education, power
- The connection between patriarchy in the home and fascism in the state
- Education as it exists reinforces hierarchy
- Questions whether women should even want entry to corrupt institutions

### Other Notable Works
- **The Voyage Out** (1915) - First novel, more conventional but with modernist elements
- **Night and Day** (1919) - Transitional novel exploring marriage as partnership
- **Jacob's Room** (1922) - Experimental character study with absent center
- **Between the Acts** (1941) - Final novel, pageant of English history
- **The Common Reader** (First Series 1925, Second Series 1932) - Literary criticism
- **"Modern Fiction"** (1925) - Manifesto for modernist technique
- **A Writer's Diary** (published posthumously) - Extracts from her journals

## Historical Context

### The Bloomsbury Group
An informal gathering of intellectuals, artists, and writers in early 20th century London. Members included:

- **Vanessa Bell** - Woolf's sister, painter
- **Clive Bell** - Art critic, Vanessa's husband
- **Duncan Grant** - Painter
- **Roger Fry** - Art critic, theorist of Post-Impressionism
- **Lytton Strachey** - Biographer
- **John Maynard Keynes** - Economist
- **E.M. Forster** - Novelist
- **Leonard Woolf** - Virginia's husband, political writer, publisher

**Shared values:**
- Rejection of Victorian morality and social convention
- Emphasis on personal relationships and aesthetic experience
- Liberal/progressive politics
- Sexual frankness (many members were gay or bisexual)

### The Hogarth Press
Founded by Virginia and Leonard Woolf in 1917, operating from their home. Published:
- All of Virginia Woolf's novels after *Jacob's Room*
- T.S. Eliot's *The Waste Land*
- First English translations of Freud
- Works by Katherine Mansfield, E.M. Forster, Vita Sackville-West

Significance: Woolf had complete control over her work, no editorial interference, no commercial pressure.

### Women and Education
- Women could attend lectures at Cambridge but could not receive degrees until 1948
- Woolf's father Leslie Stephen educated her brothers formally; she was educated at home
- This exclusion shapes *A Room of One's Own* deeply
- The difference between "the great universities" (for men) and "Fernham" (women's college with modest resources)

## Core Concepts

### The Angel in the House
Phantom that Woolf describes killing in her essay "Professions for Women" - the internalized feminine ideal that urges women to be sympathetic, flattering, self-sacrificing rather than honest.

"Had I not killed her she would have killed me. She would have plucked the heart out of my writing."

### The Androgynous Mind
In *A Room of One's Own*, Woolf proposes that the best creative minds are androgynous - not gendered masculine or feminine but incorporating both:

"It is fatal for anyone who writes to think of their sex. It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be woman-manly or man-womanly."

## Writing Process

### Daily Practice
- Wrote between 9:30 am and noon, before the day's demands accumulated
- Used a low armchair with a plywood board across her knees
- Wrote first drafts in large quarto notebooks of plain paper
- Purple ink for letters (especially to Vita Sackville-West)
- The diary as "practice" - "I do my scales here"

### Diary as Laboratory
Woolf kept diaries continuously from 1915 until four days before her death (26 volumes total).

**Functions:**
- "Training for eye and hand"
- "Loosening the ligaments"
- "Finger exercises"
- Working out ideas before committing to fiction
- Recording moments of being for later use

### Revision Process
Multiple drafts with extensive revision:
- First version in notebooks (messy, exploratory)
- Typed version with heavy corrections
- Final typed copy
- Proof revisions

## Famous Quotations

### On Writing and Creativity
- "The proper stuff of fiction does not exist; everything is the proper stuff of fiction."
- "Any method is right, every method is right, that expresses what we wish to express."
- "Let us record the atoms as they fall upon the mind in the order in which they fall."
- "How can we combine the old words in new orders so that they survive, so that they create beauty, so that they tell the truth?"
- "So long as you write what you wish to write, that is all that matters."

### On Women and Society
- "A woman must have money and a room of her own if she is to write fiction."
- "Anonymous was a woman."
- "Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind."
- "The history of men's opposition to women's emancipation is more interesting perhaps than the story of that emancipation itself."
- "As a woman I have no country. As a woman I want no country. As a woman my country is the whole world."

### On Experience and Consciousness
- "Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; life is a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end."
- "No need to hurry. No need to sparkle. No need to be anybody but oneself."
- "The eyes of others our prisons; their thoughts our cages."
- "You cannot find peace by avoiding life."

## Application Scenarios

### Creative Writing and Process
- Finding one's voice vs. imitating conventions
- The material conditions needed for sustained creative work
- Writing about consciousness and interiority
- Handling time in narrative - expansion and compression
- The diary as creative practice

### Feminist Analysis
- Examining whose voices are centered/marginalized
- The material conditions underlying "choices"
- Women's unpaid labor and its effects on other work
- Historical exclusion from education and professions
- Internalized expectations (killing the Angel)

### Understanding Consciousness
- How experience actually occurs vs. how we narrate it
- Moments of being vs. cotton wool existence
- Memory, time, and identity
- The self as multiple and changing

### Literary Criticism
- Moving beyond "great tradition" to ask whose tradition
- Judging work by its own terms, not inherited criteria
- The common reader vs. professional critic
- What makes fiction "modern" vs. conventional

### Life Design and Prioritization
- Protecting time and space for meaningful work
- Interruption patterns and who bears their cost
- Saying no to demands that fragment attention
- Recognizing material needs as legitimate, not selfish

## Mental Health Context

Woolf experienced severe mental illness throughout her life, including:
- Breakdowns following the deaths of her mother (1895) and father (1904)
- Attempted suicide in 1913
- Recurring depressive episodes
- Periods of intense productivity alternating with collapse

She completed her final novel *Between the Acts* and then, fearing another breakdown as WWII intensified, died by suicide on March 28, 1941.

**Important note:** Her mental illness was part of her experience but should not be romanticized or treated as the source of her genius. She wrote brilliantly *despite* illness, not because of it.
