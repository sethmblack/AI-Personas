## HIGH Priority

### 1. sincere-appreciation-feedback

**Source Pattern:** The Sincere Appreciation Framework + Code Review Sandwich (Carnegie Method)
**Purpose:** Transform critical technical feedback into constructive guidance that maintains relationships and achieves behavior change
**Trigger:** "Give feedback on this code/design/document" or "How do I critique this without causing conflict?" or "Review this constructively"
**Inputs:** Content to review (code, design doc, proposal); specific concerns if any; recipient context (experience level, relationship)
**Outputs:** Reframed feedback using Carnegie principles: genuine opening appreciation, indirect concern as question, confident close
**Reasoning:** Clear 4-step process that directly applies Carnegie's Part 4 principles (22-30) to technical feedback. High frequency use case in engineering teams. Saves significant relationship damage and achieves better outcomes than direct criticism. Has explicit steps and vocabulary transformations documented.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Clear steps: find praise, express specifically, introduce concerns as questions, close with confidence
- Invocable: YES - "Give Carnegie-style feedback on this code" or "Review this constructively"
- Scoped: YES - Focused on transforming feedback delivery, single responsibility
- Reusable: YES - Applies to code reviews, design reviews, performance conversations, any feedback scenario
- Valuable: YES - Prevents defensive reactions, maintains team cohesion, achieves actual change
- Decision: CANDIDATE

### 2. influence-without-authority

**Source Pattern:** Interest-Before-Influence Framework + Yes-Yes Technique for Stakeholder Alignment
**Purpose:** Persuade stakeholders or peers to adopt a position when you lack direct authority, using Carnegie's principles of making them feel the idea is theirs
**Trigger:** "How do I convince them to..." or "I need to get buy-in for..." or "Persuade without authority"
**Inputs:** The proposal/change to advocate; stakeholder concerns/interests; existing relationship context
**Outputs:** Structured persuasion plan: opening with genuine interest, questions to understand their goals, connection of proposal to their interests, technique to let them own the solution
**Reasoning:** Directly implements Carnegie's Principles 14-17 (Yes-Yes, let them talk, let them feel idea is theirs, see from their viewpoint). High-value for engineers who must influence without managing. Documented 5-step workflow with clear triggers.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Five explicit steps with examples from both stakeholder and difficult conversation patterns
- Invocable: YES - "Help me get buy-in for this proposal" or "Influence this stakeholder"
- Scoped: YES - Focused on persuasion when lacking authority
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any stakeholder, budget request, architecture proposal, process change
- Valuable: YES - Engineers often fail to get good ideas adopted due to poor influence skills
- Decision: CANDIDATE

### 3. face-saving-error-handling

**Source Pattern:** Face-Saving Framework + Post-Incident Review (Blameless Retrospective)
**Purpose:** Address mistakes, incidents, or poor performance while preserving the person's dignity and maintaining the relationship
**Trigger:** "How do I address this mistake?" or "Conduct a blameless retrospective" or "Someone messed up and I need to discuss it"
**Inputs:** The incident/mistake description; the person(s) involved; desired outcome (behavior change, process improvement)
**Outputs:** Face-saving conversation plan: private setting, own mistakes first, focus on systems not people, questions to understand, praise for corrections
**Reasoning:** Implements Carnegie's Principle 26 (let the other person save face) combined with Part 4 leadership principles. Critical for psychological safety in engineering teams. Clear 5-step workflow for post-incident reviews and individual conversations.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Five explicit steps for retrospectives and individual error conversations
- Invocable: YES - "Help me address this incident without blaming" or "Face-saving conversation plan"
- Scoped: YES - Focused specifically on handling mistakes/errors constructively
- Reusable: YES - Applies to production incidents, performance issues, project failures
- Valuable: YES - Psychological safety is critical for high-performing teams; blame cultures destroy innovation
- Decision: CANDIDATE

## MEDIUM Priority

### 4. worry-management-protocol

**Source Pattern:** The "How to Stop Worrying" Framework (Three-Step Worry Formula, Day-Tight Compartments, Four Questions)
**Purpose:** Help manage anxiety and worry in high-pressure technical situations using Carnegie's proven techniques
**Trigger:** "I'm stressed about this deadline/incident/decision" or "Help me stop worrying about..." or "Manage my anxiety about..."
**Inputs:** The worry/stressor description; deadline or time pressure if any; controllable vs uncontrollable factors
**Outputs:** Worry management plan: worst-case analysis, acceptance baseline, action focus, day-tight compartment approach
**Reasoning:** Implements Carnegie's *How to Stop Worrying and Start Living* methodology. While less frequently used than feedback/influence skills, this addresses a real need in high-pressure engineering environments. Has clear 3-step and 4-question frameworks.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Three-Step Formula and Four Questions provide explicit steps
- Invocable: YES - "Help me manage worry about this launch" or "Stop worrying protocol"
- Scoped: YES - Focused on worry/anxiety management specifically
- Reusable: YES - Applies to deadlines, on-call stress, career anxiety, incident pressure
- Valuable: YES - Burnout and anxiety are major issues in tech; proven Carnegie techniques help
- Decision: CANDIDATE

### 5. name-and-interest-protocol

**Source Pattern:** The Six Ways to Make People Like You (Principles 4-9) + Name Principle
**Purpose:** Build rapid rapport in professional situations by applying Carnegie's fundamental likability principles
**Trigger:** "I'm meeting new stakeholders" or "How do I build rapport with..." or "First meeting with a new team"
**Inputs:** Context (meeting type, participants); background on attendees if available; goals for the relationship
**Outputs:** Rapport-building plan: name memorization strategies, interest research, genuine conversation questions, follow-up reminders
**Reasoning:** Implements Carnegie's Part 2 principles systematically. Moderate frequency but high impact for those in cross-functional roles. Steps are clear but may be lower priority than feedback and influence skills.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - Six explicit principles with clear application guidance
- Invocable: YES - "Help me prepare for meeting these new stakeholders"
- Scoped: YES - Focused on initial relationship building
- Reusable: YES - Applies to any new professional relationship
- Valuable: YES - First impressions matter; systematic approach improves outcomes
- Decision: CANDIDATE
