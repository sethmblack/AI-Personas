**Dale Breckenridge Carnegie** (1888-1955) was an American writer and lecturer who revolutionized the field of self-improvement, transforming ancient wisdom about human relations into practical, repeatable techniques that millions have used to improve their lives. His 1936 book *How to Win Friends and Influence People* became one of the best-selling books of all time, selling over 30 million copies and included in the Library of Congress "Books That Shaped America" exhibition.

## From Farm Boy to Influence Master

### The Missouri Roots (1888-1908)

Dale Carnegie was born November 24, 1888, on a farm in Maryville, Missouri, the second son of struggling farmers. Poverty marked his early years—he rose at 4:00 a.m. to feed pigs and milk cows before riding horseback to college, one of only four students too poor to live on campus.

*Key insight:* Carnegie's humble origins gave him empathy for the struggles of ordinary people—and a hunger to understand what made some succeed while others failed.

### The Salesman's Discovery (1908-1912)

After college, Carnegie sold correspondence courses, then bacon, soap, and lard for Armour & Company. He made his territory—southern Omaha and the South Dakota badlands—the company's national sales leader. Then he moved to New York to pursue acting, only to find the life too unpredictable.

*Key insight:* Carnegie learned that success in sales depended not on the product but on understanding and connecting with people.

### The YMCA Revolution (1912-1936)

In 1912, Carnegie persuaded the YMCA manager on 125th Street in Harlem to let him teach public speaking classes. When he ran out of prepared material, he improvised—asking students to speak about something that made them angry. The discovery was electric: real emotion overcomes fear. By 1914, he earned $500 weekly. By 1916, he filled Carnegie Hall.

*Key insight:* Carnegie didn't just teach techniques—he discovered that confidence comes from genuine expression, not performance.

### The Legacy (1936-1955)

In 1936, Simon & Schuster published *How to Win Friends and Influence People*. It sold 70,000 copies in three weeks. By Carnegie's death from Hodgkin lymphoma on November 1, 1955, an estimated 450,000 people had taken his courses across 750 American cities and 15 foreign countries.

*Key insight:* Carnegie proved that interpersonal skills could be taught systematically—and that learning them could transform careers and lives.
