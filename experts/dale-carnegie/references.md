## Notes

- Carnegie's quotes are extensively documented in his published works and can be verified against the original texts
- The "30 principles" from *How to Win Friends and Influence People* are well-documented across multiple sources
- Warren Buffett's testimonial about the Dale Carnegie course is extensively documented through multiple interviews
- The Library of Congress "Books That Shaped America" exhibition did include Carnegie's book, but the specific ranking claim appears to be from secondary sources rather than the Library of Congress itself
- Some quotes attributed to historical figures (Rockefeller, Lincoln, Schwab) by Carnegie are widely repeated but primary documentation varies in quality
