## Overview

Socrates (c. 470-399 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher credited as the founder of Western philosophical inquiry. Unlike earlier philosophers who focused on cosmology and nature, Socrates turned philosophy inward to examine ethics, knowledge, and the nature of the good life. He left no written works; our knowledge of his thought comes primarily through the dialogues of his student Plato, as well as writings by Xenophon and Aristophanes.

Socrates was sentenced to death in 399 BC Athens for "corrupting the minds of the youth" and impiety against the gods of the state. He accepted his death sentence, refusing to escape, and drank hemlock in his prison cell—becoming philosophy's greatest martyr.

## Core Philosophical Beliefs

### "I Know That I Know Nothing" (Socratic Ignorance)

The saying derived from Plato's Apology: "For I was conscious that I knew practically nothing..." (Apology 22d). Also called the Socratic paradox.

**Origin:** The Oracle at Delphi declared Socrates the wisest of all people. Puzzled, Socrates set out to find someone wiser to disprove the Oracle. He questioned politicians (who claimed wisdom without knowledge), poets (who could touch people with words but did not understand their meaning), and craftsmen (who had knowledge only in narrow fields).

**Conclusion:** Socrates believed himself wiser only because, unlike others, he admitted his ignorance. Those who think they know are furthest from wisdom; those who recognize what they do not know are closest.

### "Know Thyself" (Gnōthi Seauton)

One of the Delphic maxims inscribed on the Temple of Apollo. While not original to Socrates, he made it central to his philosophy:

- Self-knowledge is the beginning of wisdom
- Before examining anything external, examine yourself
- Know your own character, strengths, weaknesses
- Self-examination is a moral imperative, not just intellectual exercise

For Socrates, self-knowledge is indispensable to morality because it involves constituting oneself as a person guided by knowledge toward a moral life.

### "The Unexamined Life Is Not Worth Living"

Socrates' famous declaration from the Apology. Meaning:

- Continuous self-reflection is essential to a meaningful life
- We must question our beliefs, values, and actions
- Living on unexamined assumptions is barely human life
- Philosophy is not academic but existential—a practice of caring for the soul

### Virtue is Knowledge

Socrates believed that:

- Right action follows from right understanding
- No one does wrong willingly—they do wrong from ignorance of the true good
- If someone truly knew what was best, they would do it
- Therefore, teaching virtue is possible through philosophical examination

This "intellectualist" view of ethics was challenged by Aristotle but remains influential.

### The Daimonion (Divine Sign)

Socrates spoke of an inner voice or divine sign that:

- Warned him away from wrong actions
- Was always prohibitive, never commanding
- Did not provide positive guidance, only restraint
- Was personal and non-transferable

This represents an early conception of conscience and inner moral guidance.

## Key Dialogues and Themes

### Apology
Socrates' defense speech at his trial. Contains the "unexamined life" quote and his explanation of Socratic ignorance.

### Euthyphro
Examines the nature of piety. Classic example of elenchus—Euthyphro cannot provide a definition that withstands questioning.

### Meno
"Can virtue be taught?" Includes the famous "slave boy" demonstration of recollection (anamnesis) and the paradox of inquiry.

### Republic
The nature of justice and the ideal state. Contains the Allegory of the Cave—prisoners mistaking shadows for reality.

### Symposium
The nature of love (Eros). Socrates reports the teachings of Diotima on the "ladder of love" ascending from physical beauty to the Form of Beauty.

### Theaetetus
"What is knowledge?" Contains the midwifery metaphor. Ends in aporia—no definition survives scrutiny.

### Phaedo
Socrates' last hours and arguments for the immortality of the soul. He drinks hemlock calmly, concerned with philosophy to the end.

## Modern Applications

### Education
The Socratic method is foundational in law schools, where students are questioned about cases rather than lectured. Used in humanities seminars and critical thinking courses.

### Therapy
Adapted in:
- Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
- Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT)
- Classical Adlerian psychotherapy
- Logotherapy

Used to clarify meaning, reveal assumptions, and guide clients to their own insights.

### Leadership and Coaching
Socratic questioning helps:
- Leaders develop their teams' thinking capacity
- Coaches draw out clients' own solutions
- Managers move from telling to asking

### Critical Thinking
The Socratic method trains:
- Identification of hidden assumptions
- Recognition of logical fallacies
- Tolerance for ambiguity and complexity
- Intellectual humility
