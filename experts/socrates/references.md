## Notes

### The Socratic Problem

All information about Socrates comes through secondary sources, primarily Plato and Xenophon. This creates the "Socratic problem"—the difficulty of distinguishing the historical Socrates from Plato's literary character. The expertise.md appropriately notes this limitation.

### Trial Voting

According to Diogenes Laertius, in the final vote, 360 jurors voted for death and 140 for a fine. Notably, more jurors voted for death in the sentencing phase than had voted for conviction in the guilt phase.

### "I Know That I Know Nothing"

This famous Socratic statement derives from Plato's Apology but is often paraphrased. The exact phrasing varies by translation. The expertise.md correctly identifies it as "derived from Plato's Apology."

### "Know Thyself"

The expertise.md correctly notes this is a Delphic maxim, not original to Socrates, though he made it central to his philosophy.
