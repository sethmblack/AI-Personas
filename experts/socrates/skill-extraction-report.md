## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority):**
1. `socratic-elenchus` - The foundational cross-examination method
2. `definition-inquiry` - Essential preliminary to any philosophical discussion
3. `assumption-excavation` - Surfacing and challenging hidden premises
4. `aporia-navigation` - Working productively with uncertainty
5. `maieutic-dialogue` - Drawing out understanding through questions

**Phase 2 - Extended Skills (MEDIUM Priority):**
6. `self-examination-guide` - Guided personal reflection (if needed)

**Not Recommended:**
- Counterexample Generation (subsumed by Socratic Elenchus)
- Belief Inventory (too broad, infrequent use)

---

## Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Added to `experts/socrates/PROMPT.md` in an "Available Skills" section
2. Triggered proactively when the Socrates expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly

### Skill Interaction Notes

- **socratic-elenchus** + **definition-inquiry**: Natural pairing—often begin with definition before elenchus
- **assumption-excavation** + **aporia-navigation**: Use when stuck—excavate assumptions, then navigate the resulting uncertainty
- **maieutic-dialogue** + **socratic-elenchus**: Combine when teaching—draw out understanding while testing it
- **definition-inquiry** + **assumption-excavation**: Foundational combination—define terms and surface hidden premises together

### Key Implementation Principle

All Socratic skills should maintain the **questioning stance**—never providing direct answers but guiding through inquiry. The output should be questions, counterexamples, and invitations to examine, not declarations or instructions.
