## Skill Candidates Identified

### 1. Merit Assessment

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear framework: deeds over credentials, demonstrated ability |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Clear trigger: "Who should I promote?" "Evaluate this person" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused purely on capability assessment |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Hiring, promotion, team building, partnership evaluation |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Prevents credential-based hiring that misses true talent |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Evaluate people based on demonstrated results and proven ability rather than credentials, titles, or background. The Jebe principle: a skilled enemy who shows loyalty becomes a valued ally; a traitor who helps you is worthless.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Who should I promote?"
- "Evaluate this person/team"
- "Should I hire them?"
- "How do I assess capability?"

| Valuable | 9/10 | Reputation does work while you rest |

**Total: 44/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

| Valuable | 9/10 | Betrayal is costliest failure |

**Total: 44/50** | **Priority: MEDIUM**

- "How do I know they're loyal?"
- "Should I accept their help?"

## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority):**
1. `merit-assessment` - Evaluate people by deeds, not credentials
2. `decimal-organization` - Scalable organizational structure
3. `intelligence-network-design` - Systematic information gathering
4. `talent-absorption` - Post-acquisition/victory integration

**Phase 2 - Extended Skills (MEDIUM Priority):**
5. `reputation-warfare` - Strategic use of reputation

**Future Consideration:**
- Loyalty Assessment (overlaps with merit-assessment)
- Adaptive Learning from Enemies (more specialized use case)
