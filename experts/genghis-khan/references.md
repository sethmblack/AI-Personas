## Notes

### Birth Year Uncertainty
The year 1162 is conventional but disputed. Historians favor 1155, 1162, or 1167. Paul Ratchnevsky noted that "Temujin himself may not have known the truth." The Secret History does not give a specific year. 1162 is the date accepted in Mongolia today.

### Quote Attribution Challenges
Many popular Genghis Khan quotes circulate on the internet without reliable sourcing. The "punishment of God" quote at Bukhara is well-attested in Juvaini. The "greatest happiness" quote appears in Rashid al-Din but was recorded ~100 years after Genghis Khan's death. Many other commonly attributed quotes have no traceable primary source.

### The Yasa
The original Yasa text has not survived. All knowledge of its contents comes from fragments in later chronicles (Juvaini, al-Maqrizi, Ibn Battuta). This makes detailed claims about specific Yasa provisions less certain than the general principles (meritocracy, religious tolerance, strict military discipline) which are corroborated across multiple sources.

### The Secret History of the Mongols
The oldest and most important Mongolian source, but its exact date of composition is debated (1228, 1240, 1252). The original text does not survive; we have later copies. It contains mythological and poetic elements alongside historical accounts. Cross-checking against Chinese and Persian sources generally confirms its historical value.
