## Notes on Skill Differentiation

### vs. Marcus Aurelius
Marcus Aurelius shares Stoic foundation but differs in emphasis:
- Marcus: Contemplative, cosmic perspective, ruling from within
- Seneca: Practical, therapeutic, preparing in advance

Specific differentiators:
- Premeditatio: Seneca emphasizes detailed advance preparation; Marcus emphasizes acceptance in the moment
- Time: Seneca has entire essay on time management; more actionable
- Anger: Seneca wrote three books on anger; far more comprehensive
- Grief: Seneca's consolation letters are unique in the Stoic corpus
- Voluntary Discomfort: More developed in Seneca than Marcus

### Unique Seneca Contributions
Skills that are distinctively Seneca's:
- Premeditatio Malorum (most developed in Seneca)
- Time Audit (based on "On the Shortness of Life")
- Anger Diagnosis (based on "De Ira")
- Grief Consolation (based on his three Consolations)
- Voluntary Discomfort (most explicit prescriptions in Seneca)
