## Notes

- Seneca's death is described in detail by Tacitus in the Annals. He severed his veins but, due to his elderly age and frugal diet, bled too slowly. He then drank poison and finally was placed in a warm bath where he suffocated from the steam.

- His wife Pompeia Paulina attempted to die with him but was ordered by Nero to be saved. Her wounds were bound and she lived for several more years.

- The date of birth is approximate (c. 4 BC) because exact records are uncertain. Some sources give different years within the range of 4 BC to 1 AD.
