## Core Philosophical Doctrines

### 1. Stoic Metaphysics (Background)
- Universe governed by rational providence (logos)
- Everything happens according to fate/nature
- God immanent in the universe, not separate
- Death is transformation, not annihilation

### 2. Stoic Ethics (Primary Focus)

**The Goal:** Living according to nature, which means according to reason

**Virtue as the Only Good:**
- Only virtue (wisdom, justice, courage, temperance) is truly good
- Only vice is truly evil
- Everything else is "indifferent" (preferred or dispreferred)
- Health, wealth, reputation are "preferred indifferents"—pursue them, but don't depend on them

**Emotions (Passions):**
- Negative emotions arise from false judgments
- They are not inevitable responses but errors in thinking
- Can be corrected through philosophy
- Distinguish: anger (vice) vs. righteous indignation (appropriate response)

### 3. Practical Philosophy (Distinctive Emphasis)

**Philosophy as Therapy:**
"Philosophy is the physician of the soul. As the body must be cured of its sicknesses, so the soul must be healed of its passions."

**Daily Practice:**
- Morning preparation for difficulties
- Mindful attention throughout the day
- Evening review of conduct
- Regular philosophical study
- Conversations with wise friends

**Writing as Practice:**
Seneca wrote to process his own struggles, not from achieved wisdom. His letters are exercises in self-improvement shared with others.

### Compared to Marcus Aurelius:
- More accessible and conversational
- More practical prescriptions
- More willing to engage with human weakness
- Less austere, more warm

- Less demanding; more acknowledgment of struggle
- Seneca as fellow sufferer vs. Epictetus as teacher

### Seneca's Unique Contribution:

- Created the literature of self-help in recognizable form
- Demonstrated how philosophy applies to real problems (grief, anger, time)
- Bridged theory and daily life
- Showed philosophy as ongoing practice, not achieved state

## Paradoxes and Tensions

### Wealth and Philosophy
Seneca was enormously wealthy while writing about simplicity. He addressed this directly:
- Wealth is a "preferred indifferent"—acceptable if rightly used
- The philosopher is not against riches but against attachment to riches
- He lived as one who could lose everything without losing himself
- His critics may have a point; he acknowledged the tension

### Politics and Retirement
Served a tyrant (Nero) while writing about virtue:
- Sought to moderate Nero's worst impulses
- When that became impossible, withdrew
- The question of when to engage vs. withdraw is complex
- His essays on leisure justify philosophical retirement

### Practice and Preaching
Admitted he didn't perfectly follow his own advice:
"I am not a wise man, and—to feed your malice—I never shall be."
"I am not yet ready to raise myself against Fortune... I do make progress, but slowly."

This humility is actually a strength: Seneca speaks as a fellow struggler, not a perfected sage.
