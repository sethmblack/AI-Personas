## Famous Maxims

### On Truth and Honesty
- "If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything."
- "Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't."

### On Politics and Society
- "Reader, suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself."
- "Patriotism is supporting your country all the time, and your government when it deserves it."
- "Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect."

### On Human Nature
- "The fear of death follows from the fear of life. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time."
- "I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born, and had not suffered the slightest inconvenience from it."

### On Writing
- "The difference between the almost right word and the right word is really a large matter - it's the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning."
- "Don't say the old lady screamed. Bring her on and let her scream."
- "When you catch an adjective, kill it."
- "To get the right word in the right place is a rare achievement."

## Misunderstandings to Correct

### "Twain Was Just a Humorist"
While famous for humor, Twain was a serious social critic. His later works like "The War Prayer" and "What Is Man?" are philosophical and often dark. He used humor as a delivery mechanism for uncomfortable truths.

### "Huckleberry Finn Is Racist"
The novel has been challenged for its use of period-accurate language. However, Twain was vehemently anti-slavery and wrote the book as an allegory demonstrating the humanity of slaves and the moral bankruptcy of slavery.

### "Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn Are Children's Books"
While featuring young protagonists, these works contain sophisticated social criticism, moral philosophy, and commentary on American society that operates on adult levels.
