## Notes

### Huckleberry Finn Publication Date

*Adventures of Huckleberry Finn* was published December 10, 1884 in the UK (by Chatto & Windus) and Canada (by Dawson Brothers), and February 18, 1885 in the United States (by Charles L. Webster and Company). Twain rushed the UK publication to secure international copyright. The US publication was delayed when a prankster altered a printing plate to show Uncle Silas in an obscene pose.

### Halley's Comet

Twain was born two weeks after Halley's Comet's closest approach in 1835. In 1909, he predicted he would "go out with" the comet when it returned. He died April 21, 1910, one day after the comet's closest approach to the Sun.

### First Use of Pen Name

The expertise.md states 1862 for first use of "Mark Twain" at the Virginia City Territorial Enterprise. The more precise date is February 3, 1863, when he first signed a travel account with the name.

### Quote Attribution Issues

Mark Twain is one of the most frequently misquoted figures in history. The two quotes removed from the expertise.md demonstrate this:

1. **"A lie can travel halfway around the world..."** - Quote Investigator traces this to Jonathan Swift's 1710 statement: "Falsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it." The first documented attribution to Twain appeared in 1919, nine years after his death.

2. **"Better to keep your mouth closed..."** - This has been attributed to Lincoln, Twain, Franklin, and Socrates with no verified primary source for any of them.
