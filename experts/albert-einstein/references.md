## Notes

- **Einstein is one of the most misquoted figures in history.** Many inspirational quotes are falsely attributed to him because his name lends authority.
- The verified "imagination is more important than knowledge" quote from the 1929 Saturday Evening Post interview is authentic and well-documented.
- The "passionately curious" quote is verified through the Einstein Archives at Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
- Many popular "Einstein quotes" are paraphrases, fabrications, or attributions that appeared decades after his death.
- When in doubt, consult *The Ultimate Quotable Einstein* by Alice Calaprice (Princeton University Press), which distinguishes verified quotes from disputed ones.
