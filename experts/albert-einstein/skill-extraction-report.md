**Priority Thresholds:**
- HIGH: 40+ points
- MEDIUM: 30-39 points
- LOW: 20-29 points
- REJECT: <20 points

## HIGH Priority (40+ points)

### 1. gedankenexperiment-method

**Source Pattern:** Thought Experiments (Gedankenexperimente)
**Purpose:** Construct vivid mental scenarios to explore abstract concepts, reveal hidden assumptions, and make counterintuitive ideas accessible.
**Trigger:** "Help me think through this concept" or "What if..." or "Create a thought experiment for..." or "How can I understand this intuitively?"
**Inputs:** Abstract concept or problem, domain context, target audience (optional)
**Outputs:** Structured thought experiment with scenario setup, key question, logical exploration, insight revealed, and practical implications

**Scoring:**
- Actionable: 10/10 - Clear 5-step process: setup scenario, pose question, explore limits, reveal insight, draw implications
- Invocable: 9/10 - "What if" is natural trigger; "thought experiment" is known phrase
- Scoped: 9/10 - Single purpose: illuminate concepts through mental scenarios
- Reusable: 10/10 - Applies to physics, philosophy, business strategy, product design, ethics, education
- Valuable: 10/10 - Transforms abstract into concrete; reveals hidden assumptions; makes teaching powerful

**Total: 48/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Reasoning:** Einstein's signature methodology. Thought experiments changed physics multiple times (special relativity, general relativity, EPR paradox). Highly transferable to any domain requiring conceptual exploration or communication of complex ideas.

### 2. simplicity-synthesis

**Source Pattern:** Simplicity as a Guide / "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler"
**Purpose:** Take complex material and find the simplest formulation that preserves essential truth, cutting through unnecessary complexity.
**Trigger:** "Simplify this for me" or "What's the essence of..." or "How would Einstein explain this?" or "Make this as simple as possible"
**Inputs:** Complex concept, theory, or body of information; target audience level (optional)
**Outputs:** Core insight in one sentence, accessible analogy, explanation of what was cut and why, test for "too simple" (what would be lost)

**Scoring:**
- Actionable: 9/10 - Clear process: identify core, cut complexity, create analogy, test boundaries
- Invocable: 10/10 - "Simplify this" is extremely natural; Einstein association is strong
- Scoped: 9/10 - Single purpose: distill complexity to essence
- Reusable: 10/10 - Applies to education, communication, writing, product design, strategy
- Valuable: 10/10 - Addresses universal challenge; bad simplification causes real harm

**Total: 48/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Reasoning:** "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." This skill operationalizes Einstein's commitment to elegant simplicity while warning against oversimplification. Essential for communication, teaching, and thinking clearly.

### 3. problem-deepening

**Source Pattern:** Problem-Solving Approach / "55 minutes on the problem, 5 on solutions"
**Purpose:** Before solving, deeply understand the problem—its root causes, hidden assumptions, context, and true nature.
**Trigger:** "Help me understand this problem better" or "What am I really dealing with?" or "Why is this actually hard?" or "Deepen my understanding before I solve"
**Inputs:** Initial problem statement, context, attempted solutions (if any)
**Outputs:** Reframed problem statement, identified hidden assumptions, root cause analysis, true constraints vs. perceived constraints, better questions to ask

**Scoring:**
- Actionable: 9/10 - Clear process: examine assumptions, identify root causes, separate real vs. perceived constraints, reframe
- Invocable: 8/10 - Trigger phrases work though less distinctive than "thought experiment"
- Scoped: 9/10 - Focused on problem understanding, not solution generation
- Reusable: 10/10 - Universal application: business, personal, technical, creative problems
- Valuable: 10/10 - Prevents solving wrong problem; most people skip this step

**Total: 46/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Reasoning:** Einstein's insight that understanding matters more than solving is counterintuitive and valuable. Most problem-solving frameworks jump to solutions. This skill fills a crucial gap, helping users avoid the costly error of solving the wrong problem elegantly.

### 4. imagination-knowledge-integration

**Source Pattern:** "Imagination is more important than knowledge" / Combinatory Play
**Purpose:** Integrate imaginative exploration with existing knowledge to generate creative breakthroughs and novel perspectives.
**Trigger:** "I'm stuck and need a creative breakthrough" or "How do I think beyond the obvious?" or "Help me see this differently" or "Integrate these ideas creatively"
**Inputs:** Current knowledge/constraints, desired outcome, mental blocks encountered
**Outputs:** Novel perspectives, unexpected connections, combinatory possibilities, framework for continued creative exploration

**Scoring:**
- Actionable: 8/10 - Process: inventory knowledge, identify constraints, apply combinatory play, seek unexpected connections, test novel perspectives
- Invocable: 8/10 - "Creative breakthrough" and "think differently" are natural triggers
- Scoped: 8/10 - Focused on creativity, though broader than others
- Reusable: 10/10 - Innovation, art, science, business, personal decisions
- Valuable: 9/10 - Creativity is high-value; method is distinctive

**Total: 43/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Reasoning:** Einstein's view that imagination trumps knowledge, combined with his "combinatory play" approach, offers a structured way to break creative blocks. Differs from generic creativity advice by grounding imagination in knowledge while freeing it from knowledge's constraints.

## MEDIUM Priority (30-39 points)

### 5. unity-perspective-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The Unity Perspective / Connecting physics to philosophy
**Purpose:** Find connections across seemingly separate domains to resolve paradoxes and generate integrated understanding.
**Trigger:** "How do these connect?" or "What's the bigger picture?" or "This seems contradictory—can it be unified?"
**Inputs:** Multiple perspectives, apparent contradictions, separate domains to integrate
**Outputs:** Unified framework, resolved paradoxes, higher-level principles that subsume apparent contradictions

**Scoring:**
- Actionable: 7/10 - Process exists but less structured than above skills
- Invocable: 7/10 - Triggers work but less distinctive
- Scoped: 7/10 - Broader purpose, could sprawl
- Reusable: 9/10 - Applies to interdisciplinary work, strategy, conflict resolution
- Valuable: 8/10 - Integration is valuable but requires more context

**Total: 38/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Reasoning:** Einstein's ability to see unity where others saw separation (wave-particle duality, space-time, mass-energy) is powerful but harder to operationalize as a standalone skill. Better integrated into the expert persona than extracted separately.
