## Notes

### "You Have Enemies" Quote - Victor Hugo Origin

This quote is from Victor Hugo's 1845 essay "Villemain," written 29 years before Churchill was born. Hugo wrote: "You have enemies? Why, it is the story of every man who has done a great deed or created a new idea. It is the cloud which thunders around everything that shines. Fame must have enemies, as light must have gnats."

The International Churchill Society confirms this quote does not appear in the Churchill Archive (800,000+ pages) or any documented Churchill source.

### The "Black Dog"

The expertise.md appropriately presents a nuanced view of Churchill's depression, noting that his official biographers concluded the "black dog" was "transient and never significantly disabling."

### Nobel Prize Note

Interestingly, Churchill wanted to be remembered as a peacemaker. His private secretary recalled his "early and touching joy, which turned to indifference when he learned that it was for Literature and not for Peace."
