## HIGH Priority

### 1. crisis-rhetoric

**Source Pattern:** The Three Great Speeches of 1940 + Rhetorical Devices
**Purpose:** Transform any difficult situation into a compelling, morale-boosting communication using Churchill's proven speech techniques.
**Trigger:** "Help me communicate this crisis" or "Write a rallying speech" or "How do I frame this bad news?"
**Inputs:** Situation description, audience, key message to convey, desired action/response
**Outputs:** Structured communication using anaphora, stark choice framing, concrete imagery, and a resolute conclusion
**Reasoning:** This is Churchill's core contribution—the ability to take dire circumstances and transform them into galvanizing communication. The techniques are explicit (anaphora, antithesis, litotes, concrete imagery) and highly reusable. Applies to business crisis communication, team morale, public speaking, and leadership messaging.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - explicit rhetorical techniques with clear application
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases for crisis communication
- Scoped: YES - one responsibility (crisis communication crafting)
- Reusable: YES - applies to business, politics, personal leadership, public speaking
- Valuable: YES - transforms weak communication into powerful, memorable messaging

### 2. scaffolding-of-rhetoric

**Source Pattern:** The Six Principal Elements of Oratory
**Purpose:** Analyze and improve any persuasive communication using Churchill's six-element framework from his 1897 essay.
**Trigger:** "Improve this speech" or "Make this more persuasive" or "Apply Churchill's rhetoric framework"
**Inputs:** Draft speech or persuasive text, audience, context, desired impact
**Outputs:** Analysis against six elements (diction, rhythm, accumulation, analogy, extravagance, short words) with specific improvement recommendations and revised version
**Reasoning:** Churchill codified his approach to oratory at age 23 and followed it for sixty years. The six elements provide a systematic checklist for evaluating and improving any persuasive communication. Widely applicable to speeches, presentations, written arguments, and marketing copy.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - six explicit elements with clear criteria
- Invocable: YES - can be triggered by request to improve persuasive content
- Scoped: YES - speech/persuasive text analysis and improvement
- Reusable: YES - applies to any persuasive communication

## MEDIUM Priority

### 3. defiant-reframe

**Source Pattern:** The Defiant Reversal technique
**Purpose:** Take an apparent defeat, setback, or failure and reframe it as opportunity, demonstration of character, or setup for triumph.
**Trigger:** "We just failed at..." or "How do I spin this setback?" or "Reframe this disaster"
**Inputs:** Description of defeat/setback, what actually happened, any silver linings, desired narrative
**Outputs:** Reframed narrative that acknowledges reality while extracting victory, demonstration of character, or lessons that position for future success
**Reasoning:** Churchill's genius at Dunkirk was turning military disaster into national triumph of spirit. This technique is highly applicable to business failures, personal setbacks, and organizational challenges. Provides specific framing patterns rather than vague "positive thinking."

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear pattern of acknowledge-reframe-resolve
- Invocable: YES - triggered by setback/failure scenarios
- Scoped: YES - narrative reframing of negative events
- Reusable: YES - business, personal, organizational contexts
- Valuable: YES - transforms demoralizing situations into motivating narratives

### 4. kbo-resilience

**Source Pattern:** KBO Leadership Philosophy + Black Dog Resilience
**Purpose:** Develop and apply a resilience framework for sustained difficulty, combining Churchill's persistence philosophy with practical coping mechanisms.
**Trigger:** "I'm exhausted but can't stop" or "How do I keep going?" or "Building resilience for a long challenge"
**Inputs:** Nature of ongoing challenge, current state, resources available, timeline
**Outputs:** Personalized resilience plan including mindset reframes (KBO), creative outlets, persistence strategies, and recovery mechanisms
**Reasoning:** Churchill's KBO mentality combined with his coping mechanisms (painting, writing, humor) provides a model for sustained high performance under pressure. Relevant for entrepreneurs, executives, caregivers, and anyone facing prolonged difficulty.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - specific practices and mindset tools
- Invocable: YES - triggered by fatigue/endurance scenarios
- Scoped: YES - personal resilience and persistence
- Reusable: YES - any prolonged difficulty scenario
- Valuable: YES - addresses common failure mode of burnout/giving up

### 5. historical-framing

**Source Pattern:** Historical Perspective technique + "History is watching"
**Purpose:** Elevate the significance of present actions by placing them in historical context, connecting current decisions to larger narratives.
**Trigger:** "Why does this matter?" or "Give this historical perspective" or "Frame this for the long term"
**Inputs:** Current situation/decision, relevant historical parallels, desired emotional impact
**Outputs:** Communication that connects present action to larger historical narrative, invokes future judgment, and elevates stakes appropriately
**Reasoning:** Churchill's "thousand years" framing made present sacrifice meaningful against the sweep of history. Useful for vision casting, strategic communication, and motivating teams through difficult work. However, more specialized than the rhetorical skills above.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear framing technique with examples
- Invocable: YES - triggered by need for significance/perspective
- Scoped: YES - historical context and significance framing
- Reusable: YES - vision casting, leadership, strategic communication
- Valuable: MODERATE - powerful but more situational than crisis-rhetoric
