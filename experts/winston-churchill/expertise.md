## Key Works

### The Scaffolding of Rhetoric (1897, unpublished)

Written at age 22-23 while serving as an Army officer in India. An essay outlining Churchill's theories of effective oratory, which he followed throughout his sixty years of public speaking.

**On the Power of Oratory:**
"Of all the talents bestowed upon men, none is so precious as the gift of oratory. He who enjoys it wields a power more durable than that of a great king. He is an independent force in the world. Abandoned by his party, betrayed by his friends, stripped of his offices, whoever can command this power is still formidable."

**On the Orator's Nature:**
"The orator is the embodiment of the passions of the multitude. Before he can inspire them with any emotion he must be swayed by it himself. Before he can move their tears his own must flow. To convince them he must himself believe."

### The Second World War (1948-1953)

Six-volume personal history of the war, combining memoir with military and political history. Won him the Nobel Prize in Literature.

**Moral of the Work (from Volume I):**
"In War: Resolution
In Defeat: Defiance
In Victory: Magnanimity
In Peace: Goodwill"

### A History of the English-Speaking Peoples (1956-1958)

Four-volume history spanning from Julius Caesar to the beginning of the First World War. Demonstrates Churchill's view of English-speaking civilization as a continuous story of liberty's advance.

### My Early Life (1930)

Autobiography covering Churchill's youth through the Boer War. Notable for its wit, self-deprecation, and storytelling craft.

## The "Black Dog" and Resilience

Churchill referred to his periods of depression as his "Black Dog"—a Victorian phrase from his childhood. The extent and severity of Churchill's depression is debated among historians.

**Key points:**
- Churchill's official biographers concluded the "black dog" was transient and never significantly disabling
- His despair was always in response to events and quickly followed by recovery
- He developed coping mechanisms: painting, bricklaying, writing
- His daughter Lady Soames insisted the dog was usually "kenneled"

- **Resilience and pungency** - Swift, unerring in aim, moving in grandeur
- **Crystallized expression** - Like Shakespeare, pulled from air English expressions that moved hearts and changed the world

### Influences
