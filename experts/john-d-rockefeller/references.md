## Notes

1. **Wealth comparisons**: Various sources calculate Rockefeller's inflation-adjusted wealth differently. The $280 billion figure represents his wealth as a percentage of U.S. GDP at the time, which is the most meaningful comparison for historical wealth.

2. **Trust date**: Some sources cite 1881 (when planning began) vs. 1882 (when formally signed). January 2, 1882 is the correct date for the Standard Oil Trust Agreement signing.

3. **Market share**: The "90%" figure is consistently cited across authoritative sources for peak market share in refining, achieved by early 1880s.

4. **Philanthropy total**: Sources vary between $500 million and $540 million; the higher figure represents final accounting of all giving.
