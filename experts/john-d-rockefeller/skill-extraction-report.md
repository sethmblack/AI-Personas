## HIGH Priority

### 1. efficiency-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The Efficiency Imperative
**Purpose:** Systematically identify waste, redundancy, and inefficiency in operations, processes, or systems and calculate compound savings potential.
**Trigger:** "Analyze for efficiency" or "Find waste in this system" or "Where can we cut costs without cutting quality?"
**Inputs:** Description of operations, processes, or systems to analyze; current costs if available; scale of operations (volume/frequency).
**Outputs:** Itemized waste identification with estimated savings; prioritized efficiency improvements; compound impact calculation at scale.
**Reasoning:** Clear 5-step process (identify, measure, eliminate, verify, scale), used frequently in cost optimization contexts, saves significant analysis effort, applies Rockefeller's principle that small savings multiply across scale.

### 2. vertical-integration-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Vertical Integration: Controlling the Supply Chain
**Purpose:** Analyze dependencies in a system or business and recommend integration strategies to reduce vulnerability and cost.
**Trigger:** "Assess our dependencies" or "What should we build vs. buy?" or "Where are we vulnerable to vendors?"
**Inputs:** Current system/business architecture; list of external dependencies; cost structure for each dependency; strategic importance ratings.
**Outputs:** Dependency vulnerability matrix; build vs. buy recommendations; integration priority roadmap; risk/cost analysis.
**Reasoning:** Actionable framework based on Rockefeller's Standard Oil integration strategy, directly applicable to modern technical and business decisions, saves significant strategic analysis time.

## MEDIUM Priority

### 3. consolidation-strategy

**Source Pattern:** The Consolidation Thesis
**Purpose:** Analyze fragmented systems, tools, or processes and develop a unification strategy to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency.
**Trigger:** "We have too many tools doing the same thing" or "How do we consolidate our systems?" or "Analyze fragmentation"
**Inputs:** Inventory of current tools/systems/processes; overlap analysis; usage metrics; switching costs.
**Outputs:** Fragmentation map; consolidation priority matrix; migration roadmap; efficiency gains projection.
**Reasoning:** Based on Rockefeller's systematic consolidation of the oil industry, directly applicable to modern platform engineering and tooling rationalization, moderate complexity with clear steps.

## Rejected (with reasoning)

| Pattern | Reason Not a Skill |
|---------|-------------------|
| Stewardship Philosophy | Mindset/philosophy, not actionable workflow; better as voice guidance |
| Biographical Timeline | Pure reference data, no workflow or actionability |
| Quotable Wisdom | Reference material for voice, not invocable process |
| Stories and Anecdotes | Teaching examples, not standalone processes |
| The Rockefeller Decision Framework | Too generic; elements already in other skills |
| Talent Strategy | Partial overlap with other experts; not distinctly Rockefeller |
