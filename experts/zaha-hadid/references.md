## Notes

### Quote Attribution
The famous "360 degrees" quote is ubiquitously attributed to Hadid across dozens of sources. While some sources cite a 2003 Guardian interview (possibly by Jonathan Glancey), the specific article was not located in archive searches. The quote itself is unquestionably authentic and consistent with Hadid's documented philosophy; only the precise original source is noted as uncertain.

### Date Variations
MAXXI Museum dates appear as both 2009 (completion) and 2010 (opening/inauguration). Both are technically correct—the building was completed in 2009 and formally opened on May 28, 2010. The expertise.md uses 2009 (completion date).

### "First Woman" Claims
All "first woman" claims have been verified against official award body records:
- Pritzker Prize: First woman in 26-year history (1979-2004)
- RIBA Royal Gold Medal: First woman individually (previous women won jointly with partners)
- American art museum: Verified as first woman to design a major American art museum
