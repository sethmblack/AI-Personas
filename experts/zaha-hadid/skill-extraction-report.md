## Skill Candidates

### 1. Parametric Design Analysis

**Priority:** HIGH

**Description:** Analyze any design challenge through parametric principles—identifying parameters (site, structure, program, movement, light) that can generate form through systematic relationships rather than arbitrary aesthetic choices.

| Criterion | Assessment | Score |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Actionable | Clear steps: identify parameters, establish relationships, generate variations, evaluate outcomes | 9/10 |
| Invocable | "Apply parametric thinking" or "What parameters drive this?" | 9/10 |
| Scoped | Focused on parameter identification and form generation | 8/10 |
| Reusable | Applicable to architecture, product design, UX, systems design | 9/10 |
| Valuable | Transforms arbitrary decisions into systematic exploration | 9/10 |

**Total: 44/50 - EXTRACT**

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What parameters should drive this design?"
- "Apply parametric thinking"
- "How can I generate form from constraints?"
- "Make this more systematic"

---

### 2. Fluid Space Design

**Priority:** HIGH

**Description:** Transform compartmentalized spaces into continuous experiences—applying Hadid's principles of spatial fluidity where floors become walls, boundaries dissolve, and movement flows uninterrupted.

| Criterion | Assessment | Score |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Actionable | Clear methodology: identify transitions, blur boundaries, create flow sequences | 9/10 |
| Invocable | "Make this flow" or "Remove the boundaries" | 9/10 |
| Scoped | Focused on spatial continuity and transitions | 9/10 |
| Reusable | Applicable to architecture, interior design, UX flows, information architecture | 9/10 |
| Valuable | Transforms static compartments into dynamic experiences | 9/10 |

**Total: 45/50 - EXTRACT**

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Make this space flow"
- "Remove the rigid boundaries"
- "How do I create spatial continuity?"
- "Design for movement, not containment"

---

### 3. Anti-Orthogonal Challenge

**Priority:** HIGH

**Description:** Systematically challenge the assumption that right angles and rectangular grids are the default organizing principle. Apply the "360 degrees" philosophy to explore all spatial possibilities.

| Criterion | Assessment | Score |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Actionable | Steps: identify assumed constraints, question each one, explore alternatives, evaluate new possibilities | 9/10 |
| Invocable | "Why must it be rectangular?" or "Challenge the grid" | 9/10 |
| Scoped | Focused on challenging orthogonal defaults | 8/10 |
| Reusable | Applicable to any design where boxes/grids are assumed | 8/10 |
| Valuable | Liberates thinking from unexamined convention | 9/10 |

**Total: 43/50 - EXTRACT**

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "There are 360 degrees, why stick to one?"
- "Challenge the grid"
- "Why does this need to be rectangular?"
- "Explore all the angles"

### 4. Vision Defense Framework

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Description:** Methodology for defending ambitious, unconventional ideas against criticism that they are "unbuildable," "impractical," or "impossible"—drawing on Hadid's experience of 16 years as a "paper architect" before vindication.

| Criterion | Assessment | Score |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Actionable | Steps: acknowledge criticism, reframe as "not yet," identify path to realization, maintain conviction | 8/10 |
| Invocable | "How do I defend this vision?" or "They say it's impossible" | 8/10 |
| Scoped | Focused on defending unconventional ideas | 8/10 |
| Reusable | Applicable to any innovative proposal facing skepticism | 9/10 |
| Valuable | Provides framework for maintaining vision under pressure | 8/10 |

**Total: 41/50 - EXTRACT**

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "They say this is impossible"
- "How do I defend this vision?"
- "People think this can't be built/done"
- "The idea is too radical"

### 5. Landscape Integration Assessment

**Priority:** MEDIUM

**Description:** Evaluate how well a design integrates with its site and context—treating buildings as artificial topographies that should flow with landscape rather than objects placed upon it.

| Criterion | Assessment | Score |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Actionable | Steps: analyze site forces, identify continuation opportunities, evaluate ground plane relationships | 8/10 |
| Invocable | "Does this belong to its site?" or "Evaluate landscape integration" | 8/10 |
| Scoped | Focused on site/context integration | 9/10 |
| Reusable | Applicable to architecture, urban design, landscape architecture | 8/10 |
| Valuable | Ensures designs are contextually responsive | 8/10 |

**Total: 41/50 - EXTRACT**

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Does this belong to its site?"
- "How does this integrate with context?"
- "Is this an object on the site or part of the site?"
- "Evaluate landscape integration"

---

### 6. Paper Architecture Method

**Priority:** LOW

**Description:** Using drawings, paintings, and visualizations as investigative tools rather than mere representations—exploring spatial concepts before buildability is considered.

| Criterion | Assessment | Score |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| Actionable | Steps: abstract the concept, visualize without construction constraints, investigate spatial ideas | 7/10 |
| Invocable | "Draw this without worrying about building it" | 6/10 |
| Scoped | Focused on visualization as investigation | 7/10 |
| Reusable | Limited to visual/spatial design contexts | 6/10 |
| Valuable | Liberates exploration but less procedural | 6/10 |

**Total: 32/50 - DO NOT EXTRACT (too specialized)**

## Notes

- The high-scoring skills (parametric, fluid space, anti-orthogonal) represent Hadid's core methodological contributions
- Vision defense framework captures her personal journey of persistence
- Landscape integration assessment complements Frank Lloyd Wright's site-integration-assessment with a different emphasis (topology vs. organic belonging)
- Paper architecture method is valuable conceptually but too specialized for standalone skill extraction
