# Daniel Kahneman - Expertise and Knowledge Base

## Biographical Overview

**Daniel Kahneman** (March 5, 1934 - March 27, 2024) was an Israeli-American psychologist who fundamentally transformed our understanding of human judgment and decision-making. Despite never taking an economics course, he won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics "for having integrated insights from psychological research into economic science, especially concerning human judgment and decision-making under uncertainty."

Born in Tel Aviv during the British Mandate of Palestine, Kahneman spent his early years in France during World War II. This experience of surviving Nazi occupation may have contributed to his lifelong interest in human irrationality and error. He studied psychology at Hebrew University of Jerusalem and earned his PhD from UC Berkeley in 1961.

His most consequential partnership was with Amos Tversky, which began in the late 1960s at Hebrew University and continued until Tversky's death in 1996. Together they produced some of the most cited papers in social science, including "Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases" (1974) and "Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk" (1979).

## Core Theoretical Contributions

### Heuristics and Biases Program (1970s)

Kahneman and Tversky's foundational research demonstrated that human judgment relies on mental shortcuts (heuristics) that, while often useful, lead to systematic and predictable errors (biases). The three original heuristics they identified were **Representativeness**, **Availability**, and **Anchoring and Adjustment**.

**Key Publication:** "Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases" - Science (1974)

### Prospect Theory (1979)

A descriptive theory of how people actually make decisions under risk, replacing the normative expected utility theory. Core principles include reference dependence, loss aversion, diminishing sensitivity, and probability weighting.

**Key Publication:** "Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk" - Econometrica (1979) - the most cited paper in economics

### Two Systems Model

Popularized in his 2011 bestseller *Thinking, Fast and Slow*, this framework distinguishes System 1 (automatic, effortless, intuitive) from System 2 (deliberate, effortful, logical). The key insight: we identify with System 2 but System 1 secretly runs most of our mental life.

### Noise: Unwanted Variability in Judgment

From his 2021 book with Olivier Sibony and Cass Sunstein, this work distinguishes noise (random scatter) from bias (systematic error) and introduces decision hygiene procedures to reduce unwanted variability.

## Key Biases and Phenomena

| Bias/Phenomenon | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Overconfidence** | Excessive certainty in beliefs and predictions |
| **Hindsight Bias** | "I knew it all along" after learning outcomes |
| **Confirmation Bias** | Seeking evidence that confirms existing beliefs |
| **Endowment Effect** | Overvaluing things simply because we own them |
| **Status Quo Bias** | Preferring current state over alternatives |
| **Sunk Cost Fallacy** | Continuing investment due to past costs |
| **Framing Effects** | Different decisions based on how options are presented |
| **Conjunction Fallacy** | Judging A&B as more likely than A alone |
| **Base Rate Neglect** | Ignoring statistical base rates |
| **Illusion of Validity** | Confidence persisting despite poor prediction records |
| **Planning Fallacy** | Systematic underestimation of time, cost, and risk |

## Signature Quotes

> "What you see is all there is."

> "Nothing in life is as important as you think it is while you are thinking about it."

> "We are blind to our blindness. We have very little idea of how little we know."

> "Confidence is a feeling, which reflects the coherence of the information and the cognitive ease of processing it."

> "A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth."

> "The essence of intuitive heuristics: when faced with a difficult question, we often answer an easier one instead, usually without noticing the substitution."

> "Losses loom larger than gains."

> "The experiencing self does not have a voice. The remembering self is sometimes wrong, but it is the one that keeps score."
