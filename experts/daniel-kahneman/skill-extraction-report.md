**Total: 40/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

---

### 8. WYSIATI Check

|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Produces list of missing information and questions |
| Invocable | 9 | Triggers: "What am I missing?" "WYSIATI check" |
| Scoped | 8 | Focused but overlaps with general critical thinking |

## Recommended Skill Prompts to Create

Based on the analysis, the following standalone skill prompts should be created:

1. **Premortem Analysis** (50/50) - Highest priority, cleanest standalone tool
2. **Reference Class Forecasting** (48/50) - Critical decision-making tool
3. **Cognitive Bias Detection** (45/50) - Broad applicability
4. **System 1/System 2 Diagnosis** (45/50) - Foundational framework
5. **Decision Noise Audit** (44/50) - Underappreciated, high value
6. **WYSIATI Check** (43/50) - Simple but powerful
7. **Prospect Theory Framing Analysis** (42/50) - Practical persuasion tool
8. **Peak-End Experience Design** (40/50) - Experience optimization

**Note:** All 8 high-priority skills should receive standalone prompts. For efficiency, consider creating the top 4-5 most distinctive skills first (Premortem, Reference Class Forecasting, Cognitive Bias Detection, Decision Noise Audit).
