## Notes

- All quotes in the expertise.md file are authentic and traceable to Kahneman's published works, primarily *Thinking, Fast and Slow* (2011).

- The claim that "Prospect Theory" is the "most cited paper in economics" is supported by multiple sources. Some sources qualify it as "most cited paper ever to appear in Econometrica" or "second most cited paper in economics during 1975-2000."

- Kahneman's description of the focusing illusion as his "fortune cookie maxim" comes from an essay he wrote for an online discussion site.

- Daniel Kahneman died on March 27, 2024, at age 90.
