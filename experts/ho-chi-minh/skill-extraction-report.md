## Skill Candidates Identified

### 1. Asymmetric Strategy

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 10/10 | Clear steps: identify enemy strengths, find your terrain, exploit time and will |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Clear trigger: "They're too powerful" or "We can't compete directly" |
| Scoped | 10/10 | Focused on finding leverage against stronger opponents |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to startups vs. incumbents, small vs. large, weak vs. strong |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Addresses fundamental challenge of resource-constrained actors |

**Total: 50/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** When facing a stronger opponent, find the terrain where their advantages disappear and your advantages matter. Fight your war, not theirs. Based on Ho Chi Minh's doctrine that patience, terrain, and popular support defeat material superiority.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "They're too powerful"
- "We can't compete directly"
- "They have unlimited resources"
- "How do we fight a bigger competitor?"
- "We're outmatched"

### 2. Popular Mobilization

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Clear framework: understand needs, build trust, connect strategy to people |
| Invocable | 10/10 | Clear trigger: "How do we win support?" or "People aren't engaged" |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on building deep popular connection |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to products, movements, organizational change, politics |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Addresses why technically sound strategies fail without buy-in |

**Total: 48/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Build strategy on popular foundation by understanding what people truly need, fear, and hope for. Military action without politics is like a tree without roots. Based on Ho Chi Minh's principle that holding fast to the people is the only path to lasting victory.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How do we win support?"
- "People aren't engaged"
- "Why doesn't anyone adopt this?"
- "How do we build a movement?"
- "The users/customers/employees aren't buying in"

### 3. Strategic Patience

| Criterion | Score | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Actionable | 9/10 | Framework: assess time horizon, identify what patience enables, plan for persistence |
| Invocable | 9/10 | Trigger: "How long will this take?" or "I'm losing patience" |
| Scoped | 9/10 | Focused on developing multi-year discipline |
| Reusable | 10/10 | Applies to any long-term endeavor: careers, companies, movements |
| Valuable | 10/10 | Prevents the most common strategic failure: giving up too soon |

**Total: 47/50** | **Priority: HIGH**

**Description:** Develop the discipline for decades-long thinking when circumstances require it. The river wears away the mountain not by force but by constancy. Based on Ho Chi Minh's thirty years abroad and twenty-five years of struggle.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "How long will this take?"
- "I'm losing patience"
- "When will we see results?"
- "This is taking too long"
- "Should we give up?"

**Note:** Overlaps with Mandela's strategic-patience skill but has different emphasis (asymmetric warfare context vs. reconciliation context).

| Valuable | 9/10 | Breaks conventional thinking within single tradition |

## Recommended Implementation

**Phase 1 - Core Skills (HIGH Priority):**
1. `asymmetric-strategy` - Fighting on your terms, not theirs
2. `popular-mobilization` - Building the people foundation
3. `strategic-patience-hcm` - The decades perspective (or integrate with Mandela version)
4. `cultural-synthesis` - Drawing wisdom across traditions

**Future Consideration:**
- Humble Authority (could be standalone or incorporated into leadership skills)
- Protracted Conflict Management (covered by asymmetric strategy + strategic patience)
- Adversary Will Assessment (covered by existing adversary-understanding skill)

---

## Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Added to `experts/ho-chi-minh/PROMPT.md` in the "Available Skills" section (already integrated)
2. Triggered proactively when the Ho Chi Minh expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly

## Cross-Expert Skill Relationships

| Ho Chi Minh Skill | Related Skills from Other Experts |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Asymmetric Strategy | Sun Tzu's terrain analysis, Bolivar's impossible march |
| Popular Mobilization | Mandela's reconciliation framework, Bolivar's revolutionary rhetoric |
| Strategic Patience | Mandela's strategic patience (different emphasis: asymmetric vs. reconciliation) |
| Cultural Synthesis | No direct parallel (distinctive to Ho Chi Minh's worldview) |
| Humble Authority | Mandela's dignity under pressure (different angle: building vs. maintaining) |

## Unique Contribution

Ho Chi Minh's skill set offers a distinctive combination:

1. **Asymmetric focus** - Unlike military strategists who assume rough parity, Ho Chi Minh explicitly addresses the weak defeating the strong

2. **Cultural range** - Unlike ideologically narrow figures, Ho synthesized Confucian, Buddhist, Marxist, and Western democratic traditions

3. **Popular primacy** - More explicit than many strategists about the absolute necessity of popular connection

4. **Patience extremity** - Thirty years abroad, twenty-five years of war - a time horizon few match

5. **Humble authority model** - The stilt house vs. palace choice offers concrete application of authentic leadership

These make Ho Chi Minh's skills particularly applicable to:
- Startups competing with established players
- Social movements facing powerful opposition
- Change agents working within large organizations
- Leaders seeking authentic credibility
- Anyone thinking in longer time horizons than typical business planning
