## HIGH Priority

### 1. grassroots-adoption-strategy

**Source Pattern:** Door-to-Door Model / Agent Network
**Purpose:** Develop strategies for building adoption through direct engagement and community champions when traditional channels are unavailable or insufficient.
**Trigger:** "How do we grow without marketing budget?" or "Build adoption grassroots" or "Create champions program" or "Direct community outreach"
**Inputs:** Product/initiative to promote; target community; available resources; barriers to traditional channels.
**Outputs:** Champion program design; community engagement strategy; demonstration plan; success metrics.
**Reasoning:** Combines Walker's door-to-door and agent model; directly applicable to developer relations, internal tool adoption, and resource-constrained marketing.

### 2. barrier-workaround-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The Perseverance Methodology / Creative Problem Solving
**Purpose:** Systematically identify alternatives when traditional paths are blocked—transforming constraints into creative opportunities.
**Trigger:** "We can't get approval/budget/access" or "Traditional approach isn't working" or "How do we work around this barrier?"
**Inputs:** The barrier/constraint; desired outcome; available resources; stakeholder landscape.
**Outputs:** Alternative path analysis; resource reallocation options; coalition-building strategy; phased approach.
**Reasoning:** Based on Walker's fundamental approach of refusing to accept closed doors; high reuse for resource-constrained situations.

| Philanthropic Integration | Too broad and values-based; not a specific process |
| Transformation Demonstration | Marketing tactic, better as guidance within other skills |
| Community Uplift | Philosophy underlying other skills, not standalone process |
