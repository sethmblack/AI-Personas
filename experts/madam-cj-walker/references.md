## Notes

1. **"First Female Self-Made Millionaire" claim**: Guinness World Records lists Walker as the first female self-made millionaire. Some historians note that other women (like Mary Ellen Pleasant) might have similar claims, but Walker's wealth is the best documented.

2. **Wealth estimates**: Walker denied being a millionaire during her lifetime. However, her New York real estate alone was valued at $700,000 at death, plus her controlling interest in a $500,000/year business, bringing estimated net worth over $1 million.

3. **Agent numbers**: Sources vary between "thousands" and "nearly 20,000" for trained agents by 1917. The higher figure comes from company claims.

4. **Lelia College**: Operated in Pittsburgh (1908) and later other locations to train Walker agents.
