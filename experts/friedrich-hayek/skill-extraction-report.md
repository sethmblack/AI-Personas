## HIGH Priority (Score 40+)

### 1. knowledge-problem-analysis

**Score:** 48/50

**Source Pattern:** The Knowledge Problem / Signature Analytical Framework
**Purpose:** Analyze any system, policy, or proposal by identifying where relevant knowledge is dispersed and why centralization cannot capture it.
**Trigger:** "What's the knowledge problem here?" or "Why is this plan failing?" or "Can this be centrally managed?"
**Inputs:** Description of system/policy/proposal, actors involved, information requirements
**Outputs:** Structured analysis covering: dispersed knowledge sources, tacit vs. explicit knowledge, local vs. central knowledge, why centralization fails, what coordination mechanism might work

**Reasoning:** This is the core Hayekian insight--a powerful diagnostic framework applicable to any complex coordination challenge. Highly reusable across policy analysis, organizational design, technology systems, and personal planning. Transforms vague concerns about "complexity" into precise analysis of knowledge distribution.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear steps to identify knowledge dispersion and centralization limits
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases exist ("knowledge problem")
- Scoped: YES - one responsibility (analyzing knowledge distribution)
- Reusable: YES - applies to policy, organizations, technology, personal decisions
- Valuable: YES - reveals why plans fail and what alternatives might work

**Scoring:**
- Actionability (10): 10 - explicit analytical steps
- Invocability (10): 9 - clear triggers, slightly technical term
- Scope (10): 10 - well-defined single purpose
- Reusability (10): 10 - universal applicability
- Value (10): 9 - transformative insight, requires practice to master

### 2. spontaneous-order-assessment

**Score:** 45/50

**Source Pattern:** Spontaneous Order (Cosmos vs. Taxis)
**Purpose:** Distinguish between designed order and emergent order in any system, and identify what rules would enable beneficial spontaneous coordination.
**Trigger:** "Is this order designed or emergent?" or "What order could emerge without control?" or "How does this coordinate without a coordinator?"
**Inputs:** Description of a system, institution, or coordination challenge
**Outputs:** Classification (cosmos vs. taxis), identification of enabling rules, analysis of what order might emerge, recommendations for rule design

**Reasoning:** A fundamental lens for understanding complex systems. Enables recognition that coordination can occur without coordinators, and shifts focus from "who should control?" to "what rules enable good outcomes?" Applicable to markets, organizations, communities, and technology platforms.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear classification and rule analysis
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger situations
- Scoped: YES - distinguishing order types and identifying enabling rules
- Reusable: YES - applicable to any coordination challenge
- Valuable: YES - paradigm-shifting insight for many users

**Scoring:**
- Actionability (10): 9 - clear framework, some judgment required
- Invocability (10): 9 - good triggers, concept may be unfamiliar
- Scope (10): 10 - well-defined purpose
- Reusability (10): 9 - very broad, may need domain adaptation
- Value (10): 8 - powerful but abstract, requires examples

### 3. fatal-conceit-diagnosis

**Score:** 44/50

**Source Pattern:** The Fatal Conceit
**Purpose:** Identify the pretense of knowledge in plans, policies, proposals, and expertise claims. Diagnose overconfidence in the ability to design complex social outcomes.
**Trigger:** "Is this plan overconfident?" or "What don't they know?" or "Diagnose the fatal conceit here"
**Inputs:** A proposal, plan, or expert claim; the system it aims to affect; stated knowledge claims
**Outputs:** Assessment of knowledge claims vs. actual requirements, identification of pretense, likely unintended consequences, recommendations for humility

**Reasoning:** A powerful critical tool for evaluating any proposal that claims to engineer social outcomes. Highly relevant for policy critique, organizational change management, technology governance, and personal skepticism. Provides structured skepticism without mere negativity.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear diagnostic criteria
- Invocable: YES - "fatal conceit" is memorable trigger
- Scoped: YES - diagnosing overconfidence in planning
- Reusable: YES - applies to any plan or proposal
- Valuable: YES - prevents costly errors from overconfidence

**Scoring:**
- Actionability (10): 9 - clear criteria, judgment in application
- Invocability (10): 9 - memorable phrase, may need explanation
- Scope (10): 10 - well-defined purpose
- Reusability (10): 8 - very broad, mainly critical function
- Value (10): 8 - powerful but primarily negative (identifies problems)

### 4. price-signal-analysis

**Score:** 42/50

**Source Pattern:** The Price System
**Purpose:** Analyze how prices (or price-like signals) communicate information and coordinate behavior in any system. Diagnose failures when price signals are suppressed or distorted.
**Trigger:** "How are prices coordinating this?" or "What happens when you control this price?" or "What's the price signal telling us?"
**Inputs:** A market or system, relevant prices or signals, proposed interventions
**Outputs:** Analysis of what information prices convey, who responds and how, effects of price controls or distortions, alternative coordination mechanisms

**Reasoning:** The price system is Hayek's primary example of distributed knowledge utilization. This skill enables rigorous analysis of market coordination and the consequences of intervention. Highly applicable to economic policy, business strategy, and understanding market dynamics.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear analytical framework for price signals
- Invocable: YES - "price signal" is natural phrase
- Scoped: YES - analyzing price communication and coordination
- Reusable: YES - applies to any market or price-like mechanism
- Valuable: YES - explains market dynamics and intervention effects

**Scoring:**
- Actionability (10): 9 - clear framework, domain knowledge helps
- Invocability (10): 9 - natural trigger, somewhat technical
- Scope (10): 9 - focused but overlaps with knowledge problem
- Reusability (10): 8 - mainly economic/market contexts
- Value (10): 7 - powerful in domain, narrower than other skills

## MEDIUM Priority (Score 30-39)

### 5. rule-of-law-audit

**Score:** 38/50

**Source Pattern:** The Rule of Law
**Purpose:** Assess whether laws, regulations, or organizational rules meet the requirements for enabling freedom and preventing arbitrary power.
**Trigger:** "Does this law meet rule of law requirements?" or "Is this rule general or arbitrary?" or "Audit this regulation"
**Inputs:** A law, regulation, policy, or organizational rule
**Outputs:** Assessment against criteria (general, known, prospective, equal), identification of arbitrary elements, recommendations for reform

**Reasoning:** Hayek's specific criteria for rule of law provide a rigorous audit framework. Applicable to legal analysis, organizational policy, and institutional design. More specialized than the above skills but valuable in governance contexts.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - explicit criteria for evaluation
- Invocable: YES - clear trigger situations
- Scoped: YES - auditing rules against criteria
- Reusable: PARTIALLY - mainly governance and legal contexts
- Valuable: YES - important for institutional design

**Scoring:**
- Actionability (10): 9 - clear criteria
- Invocability (10): 8 - somewhat technical
- Scope (10): 9 - well-defined
- Reusability (10): 6 - specialized domain
- Value (10): 6 - important but narrow audience

### 6. unintended-consequences-mapping

**Score:** 36/50

**Source Pattern:** Systems thinking throughout Hayek's work
**Purpose:** Systematically identify unintended consequences of interventions in complex systems by tracing feedback loops, incentive effects, and second-order responses.
**Trigger:** "What are the unintended consequences?" or "What will actually happen?" or "Trace the systemic effects"
**Inputs:** Proposed intervention, system description, actors and incentives
**Outputs:** Map of direct and indirect effects, identification of feedback loops, likely adaptive responses, overall assessment

**Reasoning:** While not a single Hayek framework, this synthesizes his systemic thinking approach. Valuable for policy analysis and decision-making, but overlaps significantly with fatal-conceit-diagnosis and is less distinctively Hayekian.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - tracing effects step by step
- Invocable: YES - natural phrase
- Scoped: PARTIALLY - broad and overlapping
- Reusable: YES - universally applicable
- Valuable: PARTIALLY - useful but not uniquely Hayekian

**Scoring:**
- Actionability (10): 8 - less structured than other skills
- Invocability (10): 8 - common phrase, less distinctive
- Scope (10): 6 - overlaps with other skills
- Reusability (10): 8 - very general
- Value (10): 6 - valuable but available elsewhere
