## Notes

### The Fatal Conceit Authorship Controversy

*The Fatal Conceit* (1988) was published under Hayek's name but edited by William Warren Bartley. There is significant scholarly debate about how much of the book was actually written by Hayek himself versus Bartley. Evidence includes:

- A January 16, 1988 letter from Bartley to Leif Wenar (another Hayek research assistant) revealed that Bartley encouraged Wenar to edit Hayek's work extensively, including composing "introductions, conclusions, connective material, and summaries on Hayek's behalf."
- Hayek was in declining health during the late 1980s.
- Bruce Caldwell, editor of *The Collected Works of F.A. Hayek*, has expressed concerns about the extent of Bartley's editorial involvement.

While the ideas in *The Fatal Conceit* are consistent with Hayek's lifelong philosophical positions, the famous "curious task of economics" quote should be attributed with this caveat about the book's contested provenance.

### The 1974 Nobel Prize

Hayek and Gunnar Myrdal shared the 1974 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics despite holding opposite economic and political views. Hayek himself believed he was paired with Myrdal to "balance" the award politically. This was the first Nobel Prize awarded to a free-market economist.

### Mont Pelerin Society

The founding meeting in 1947 included 39 scholars, predominantly economists with some historians and philosophers. Key founding members included Karl Popper, Frank Knight, Ludwig von Mises, George Stigler, and Milton Friedman. Eight members of the society have won the Nobel Prize in Economics.
