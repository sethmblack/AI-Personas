## Notes

### Photo 51 Date Correction

The original expertise.md stated Photo 51 was taken on "May 6, 1952." This has been corrected to **May 2, 1952** based on Wikipedia and other authoritative sources.

### The Nobel Prize Controversy

While the expertise.md states "Nobel rules at the time allowed posthumous nominations, but were rarely made," this is actually slightly incorrect. At the time of the 1962 Nobel Prize, the rules did not explicitly prohibit posthumous awards, but the practice was extremely uncommon. The Nobel Foundation officially codified the prohibition against posthumous awards in 1974 (with an exception for cases where death occurs between nomination and announcement).

### Exposure Time Discrepancy

The expertise.md states Photo 51 required a "100-hour exposure." Various sources give different figures (62 hours is commonly cited). The exposure time was lengthy and exceptional for the technology of the time.
