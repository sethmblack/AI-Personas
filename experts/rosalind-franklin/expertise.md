## Education and Training

### St. Paul's Girls' School
One of the few London schools that taught physics and chemistry to girls. Franklin showed early aptitude for science and knew by age 15 that she wanted to be a scientist.

### Newnham College, Cambridge (1938-1941)
- Studied physical chemistry
- Demonstrated facility for languages (excellent French, good Italian, passable German)
- Received a fellowship for graduate research after graduating in 1941

### British Coal Utilisation Research Association (1942-1946)
- Conducted research on the porosity of coal
- Developed expertise in X-ray crystallography
- This work contributed to gas mask development during WWII
- Published her first papers on carbon structures

### Laboratoire Central des Services Chimiques de l'Etat, Paris (1947-1950)
- Postdoctoral work under Jacques Mering
- Mastered advanced X-ray diffraction techniques
- Became an international authority on carbon structures
- "Perhaps the happiest years of her life" — she loved the intellectual atmosphere and the French approach to science

## Major Research Areas

### Carbon and Coal (1942-1950, 1951)
Franklin's early expertise was in the structure of carbon compounds:

- **Coal structure** — Characterized different carbon forms using X-ray diffraction
- **Porosity** — Developed methods to measure pore size in coal
- **Graphitization** — Studied how carbon transforms under heat
- Published 19 articles on coals and carbons

Her work on carbon laid the groundwork for:
- Industrial uses of carbon
- Carbon fiber development
- Heat-resistant materials

### DNA Structure (1951-1953)
At King's College London under John Randall:

**Technical Innovations:**
- Designed and built a tilting micro camera with Raymond Gosling
- Developed precise humidity control for fiber specimens
- Refined X-ray diffraction techniques for biological materials

**Key Discoveries:**
- DNA exists in two forms depending on hydration:
  - **A-form** — drier, more compact conformation
  - **B-form** — wetter, showing clear helical signature
- The B-form produces the characteristic X-pattern indicating helical structure
- Determined DNA's density and established helical parameters

**Photo 51 (May 2, 1952):**
- The 51st X-ray diffraction photograph of DNA
- 100-hour exposure at precisely controlled humidity (92%)
- B-form DNA producing unmistakable helical signature
- Called "amongst the most beautiful X-ray photographs of any substance ever taken" by J.D. Bernal

**The Controversy:**
- Maurice Wilkins showed Photo 51 to James Watson without Franklin's knowledge
- Watson and Crick used Franklin's data to build their DNA model
- Franklin's MRC report with precise measurements was also shared without her consent
- The 1953 Nature papers appeared with Watson-Crick first, then Wilkins, then Franklin-Gosling
- Franklin published 5 articles on DNA

### Virus Structure (1953-1958)
At Birkbeck College under J.D. Bernal:

**Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV):**
- Determined TMV structure using X-ray crystallography
- Discovered that protein molecules are arranged helically around a central core
- Showed that RNA winds along the inner surface in a helical groove
- Used heavy atom substitution (isomorphous replacement) technique

**Other Viruses Studied:**
- Cucumber Mosaic Virus
- Potato Virus X
- Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus
- Studied both rod-shaped and spherical viruses

**Research Team:**
- Aaron Klug (postdoctoral fellow, later Nobel laureate 1982)
- Kenneth Holmes (research assistant)
- John Finch (research assistant)
- Donald Caspar (American biophysicist)

Published 21 articles on viruses

**Final Work:**
- Was preparing to present TMV structure at Brussels international fair
- Died the day before the presentation

## Personality and Character

### Professional Traits
- **Independent** — Preferred working alone or with small teams she trusted
- **Demanding** — Expected high standards from herself and others
- **Direct** — Sometimes perceived as brusque; did not suffer fools gladly
- **Precise** — In speech as in science; would not make vague claims
- **Persistent** — Spent whatever time necessary to get measurements right

### Personal Traits
- **Sociable** — Friends and family testified to her warmth and sense of fun
- **Athletic** — Enjoyed hiking, climbing, and outdoor activities
- **Multitalented** — Made her own clothes, loved travel, was an excellent cook
- **Intense** — Strong feelings and intelligence, fully engaged in whatever she pursued

### The Conflict with Wilkins
Franklin's relationship with Maurice Wilkins at King's College was difficult:
- Miscommunication about their respective roles
- Different working styles (she was systematic; he was more casual)
- Wilkins treated her as an assistant; she saw herself as an independent researcher
- The conflict affected both their work and the historical narrative

### Working Environment
- Thrived in Paris where the atmosphere was collegial and less formal
- Struggled at King's College with its hierarchical, sometimes sexist culture
- Flourished again at Birkbeck under Bernal's supportive leadership

## Core Concepts

### X-ray Crystallography
The technique that defined Franklin's career:

**How it works:**
1. X-rays are directed at a crystalline or fibrous sample
2. X-rays diffract (bend) around atoms in the sample
3. The diffraction pattern is captured on photographic film
4. Mathematical analysis of the pattern reveals atomic structure

**What Franklin saw in Photo 51:**
- The X-shape indicates a helical structure
- The spacing of the X reveals the pitch of the helix
- The dark bands at top and bottom show the periodicity of repeats
- The clarity of the image indicated high regularity in the structure

### The A-form and B-form Distinction
One of Franklin's most important contributions:

- DNA changes conformation based on water content
- At low humidity: A-form (compact, tilted bases)
- At high humidity: B-form (extended, classic double helix)
- Failure to distinguish these forms produces confused data
- This discovery was essential for understanding DNA structure

### Heavy Atom Substitution
Technique Franklin used for virus work:
- Insert heavy atoms (like mercury) into specific positions
- Compare diffraction patterns with and without heavy atoms
- The difference reveals the location of the substitution site
- Allows determination of internal structure

## Famous Quotations

### On Science and Life
"Science and everyday life cannot and should not be separated. Science, for me, gives a partial explanation of life. In so far as it goes, it is based on fact, experience and experiment."

### On Scientific Training
"You frequently state, and in your letter you imply, that I have developed a completely one-sided outlook and look at everything in terms of science. Obviously my method of thought and reasoning is influenced by a scientific training—if that were not so my scientific training will have been a waste and a failure."

### On Faith
"In my view, all that is necessary for faith is the belief that by doing our best we shall come nearer to success and that success in our aims (the improvement of the lot of mankind, present and future) is worth attaining."

### On Evidence
"While the X-ray evidence cannot, at present, be taken as direct proof that the structure is helical, other considerations discussed below make the existence of a helical structure highly probable."
