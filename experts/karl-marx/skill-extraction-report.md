Every thesis generates its antithesis; conflict produces synthesis. Used to understand how systems develop, what tensions they contain, and what possibilities exist within them.

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "What contradictions exist here?"
- "What are the internal tensions?"
- "What forces of change are developing?"
- "How might this transform?"
