## Notes

- Marx is frequently misquoted, particularly with fake quotes about modern phenomena (consumer credit, social media) he could not have predicted.
- The "opium of the people" quote is often taken out of context. In full context, Marx shows some sympathy for religion as response to genuine suffering.
- Many quotes attributed to Marx are actually from Engels or are paraphrases of Marx's ideas rather than direct quotations.
- The translation of German terms matters: "ursprünglich" in primitive accumulation can be "original" or "primitive," affecting interpretation.
- The Eighteenth Brumaire quote about tragedy/farce is frequently shortened; the full opening credits Hegel.
