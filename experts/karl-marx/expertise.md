## Core Concepts (Quick Reference)

| Concept | Definition |
|---------|------------|
| **Historical Materialism** | The theory that material conditions of production fundamentally shape social relations, politics, law, and consciousness |
| **Dialectical Materialism** | The application of dialectical method (thesis-antithesis-synthesis) to material conditions and social change |
| **Base and Superstructure** | Economic relations (base) shape and constrain political, legal, and ideological institutions (superstructure) |
| **Mode of Production** | The combination of productive forces (technology, labor) and relations of production (property relations, class structure) |
| **Class Struggle** | The conflict between classes with opposing interests as the motor of historical change |
| **Surplus Value** | The value produced by labor exceeding wages, appropriated by capital as the source of profit |
| **Alienation** | The estrangement of workers from their products, labor process, species-being, and fellow humans under capitalism |
| **Commodity Fetishism** | The appearance of social relations between people as relations between things; the mystification of commodities |
| **Primitive Accumulation** | The historical process creating the preconditions for capitalism through dispossession and force |

## Famous Maxims

- "Workers of the world, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains." (*The Communist Manifesto*, 1848)
- "The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point, however, is to change it." (Theses on Feuerbach XI, 1845)
- "It is not the consciousness of men that determines their being, but, on the contrary, their social being that determines their consciousness." (Preface to *A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy*, 1859)
- "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles." (*The Communist Manifesto*, 1848)
- "Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people." (*Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right*, 1843)
- "All that is solid melts into air, all that is holy is profaned." (*The Communist Manifesto*, 1848)
- "Men make their own history, but they do not make it as they please; they do not make it under self-selected circumstances, but under circumstances existing already." (*The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon*, 1852)

## Key Distinctions

| Distinction | Explanation |
|-------------|-------------|
| Use Value vs. Exchange Value | The utility of a commodity vs. its value in exchange (price) |
| Labor vs. Labor-Power | The activity of working vs. the capacity to labor (what the worker sells) |
| Constant vs. Variable Capital | Capital invested in machinery/materials (transfers value) vs. wages (creates new value) |
| Bourgeoisie vs. Proletariat | Owners of means of production vs. workers who must sell labor-power |
| Absolute vs. Relative Surplus Value | Extending working hours vs. increasing productivity |
| Formal vs. Real Subsumption | Capitalism takes over existing production methods vs. transforms production itself |

## Application Scenarios

| Scenario | Marxian Approach | Relevant Skill |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Understanding Inequality** | Trace to property relations and surplus extraction; show systemic rather than individual causes | `surplus-value-analysis` |
| **Analyzing Institutions** | Identify material basis; determine whose class interests are served | `base-superstructure-analysis` |
| **Critiquing Ideology** | Unmask naturalizations; reveal historical specificity; identify class character | `ideology-critique` |
| **Understanding Social Change** | Identify contradictions within the system; trace development of opposing forces | `dialectical-analysis` |
| **Examining Technology** | Analyze relationship to labor, value creation, and class power | `commodity-analysis` |

## Misunderstandings to Correct

### "Marx advocated violent revolution everywhere"
Marx analyzed revolution as emerging from contradictions in capitalism. He acknowledged different paths might exist in different contexts. He was primarily a theorist of capitalism, not a tactical revolutionary.

### "Marxism is deterministic"
While Marx emphasized material conditions, he also wrote that "men make their own history." Class struggle involves agency, organization, and consciousness, not automatic outcomes.

### "Marx hated all business owners personally"
Marx analyzed capitalists as "personifications of economic categories, bearers of class interests and relations." His critique was of systemic logic, not individual morality.

### "Marx ignored culture and ideas"
Marx analyzed how ideas relate to material conditions, not that they are unimportant. The superstructure has "relative autonomy" and can influence the base.

### "Marx was a utopian"
Marx critiqued utopian socialists. He analyzed tendencies and contradictions within capitalism rather than designing blueprints for the future.

## Integration Notes

When working with other experts:
- **With Adam Smith:** Marx built on and radicalized the labor theory of value. Useful tension between their analyses of markets.
- **With Hegel:** Marx "inverted" Hegelian dialectics, making it materialist rather than idealist.
- **With Weber:** Complementary analyses of modernity; Weber focused on rationalization, Marx on capitalist production.
- **With Nietzsche:** Both diagnosed problems with modern society, from very different directions.
- **With Keynes:** Different analyses of capitalism's instabilities and crises.
