## HIGH Priority

### 1. uncertainty-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Fundamental Uncertainty / A Treatise on Probability
**Purpose:** Distinguish genuine uncertainty from calculable risk, and adjust decision-making approach accordingly.
**Trigger:** "Is this situation risky or uncertain?" or "Can we calculate the odds here?" or "How should I plan when I can't know the future?"
**Inputs:** Description of decision context, available information, what is known vs. unknown
**Outputs:** Classification (risk vs. uncertainty), appropriate decision framework, recommendations for building resilience vs. optimizing expected value
**Reasoning:** Keynes's foundational insight from philosophy applied to practical decisions. Most people treat all uncertainty as calculable risk, leading to false precision and fragile plans. This framework prevents that error. Widely applicable to strategy, investment, career decisions, project planning.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear classification and framework selection
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases exist
- Scoped: YES - one responsibility (risk/uncertainty classification)
- Reusable: YES - applies to any planning or decision context
- Valuable: YES - prevents catastrophic planning errors

### 2. expectations-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The Beauty Contest / Higher-Order Expectations
**Purpose:** Analyze situations where outcomes depend on what people believe others believe, mapping the layers of expectations.
**Trigger:** "What do people expect will happen?" or "Is this about fundamentals or psychology?" or "Beauty contest analysis"
**Inputs:** Situation description, key actors, observable beliefs or behaviors
**Outputs:** Multi-level expectations map (what actors believe, what they believe others believe), identification of coordination points, strategic implications
**Reasoning:** Keynes's most distinctive analytical tool. Markets, politics, and social dynamics often operate on recursive expectations rather than objective truth. Understanding this prevents naive reliance on fundamentals and enables strategic positioning. Essential for market analysis, negotiation, and coordination problems.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - structured analysis with clear outputs
- Invocable: YES - distinctive trigger phrase ("beauty contest")
- Scoped: YES - expectations mapping only
- Reusable: YES - markets, politics, social coordination
- Valuable: YES - reveals hidden drivers of behavior

**Score: 48**

### 3. composition-fallacy-check

**Source Pattern:** Paradox of Thrift / Aggregate vs. Individual
**Purpose:** Identify when individually rational behavior creates collectively irrational outcomes.
**Trigger:** "Does this make sense at scale?" or "What if everyone did this?" or "Check for composition fallacy"
**Inputs:** Proposed action or strategy, the system it operates within, other actors' likely responses
**Outputs:** Assessment of individual vs. aggregate effects, identification of paradoxes, systemic recommendations
**Reasoning:** One of Keynes's most important contributions to economic thinking. The paradox of thrift is just one example - composition fallacies appear everywhere (traffic, arms races, credential inflation). This skill prevents the common error of assuming micro-rationality implies macro-rationality.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear check with defined outputs
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases
- Scoped: YES - composition fallacy identification
- Reusable: YES - economics, strategy, social policy, system design
- Valuable: YES - catches systematic reasoning errors

**Score: 44**

### 4. contrarian-value-assessment

**Source Pattern:** Keynes's Investment Principles (Post-1929)
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether a neglected or unpopular position/asset represents genuine value or justified rejection.
**Trigger:** "Is this undervalued or just bad?" or "Should I go against the crowd?" or "Contrarian value check"
**Inputs:** Asset/position description, reasons for current unpopularity, fundamental analysis
**Outputs:** Value assessment (genuine value vs. justified rejection), confidence level, risks of contrarian position, timing considerations
**Reasoning:** Keynes lost and rebuilt fortunes learning this. Being contrarian is not automatically virtuous - sometimes the crowd is right. This framework helps distinguish genuine mispricing from deserved unpopularity. Critical for investment, career decisions, and strategic positioning.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - clear assessment framework
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases
- Scoped: YES - contrarian opportunity evaluation
- Reusable: YES - investing, careers, strategy
- Valuable: YES - prevents both herd mentality and contrarian traps

**Score: 42**

### 5. facts-changed-audit

**Source Pattern:** "When the facts change, I change my mind"
**Purpose:** Systematically review whether facts underlying a current position have changed, warranting position change.
**Trigger:** "Should I change my position?" or "Have the facts changed?" or "Facts changed audit"
**Inputs:** Current position, original reasoning, new information or changed circumstances
**Outputs:** Assessment of whether facts have materially changed, recommendation to maintain or update position, articulation of new position if warranted
**Reasoning:** Intellectual flexibility as systematic practice. Most people either change positions too easily (no conviction) or too reluctantly (rigidity). This framework enables principled flexibility - changing when warranted, holding when not.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - structured audit process
- Invocable: YES - distinctive trigger phrase
- Scoped: YES - position reassessment only
- Reusable: YES - any domain with evolving information
- Valuable: YES - enables principled flexibility

**Score: 43**

## MEDIUM Priority

### 6. animal-spirits-diagnostic

**Source Pattern:** Animal Spirits / Investment Psychology
**Purpose:** Assess the role of confidence, optimism, and instinct in a situation, separate from rational calculation.
**Trigger:** "What's the mood here?" or "Is this rational or emotional?" or "Animal spirits check"
**Inputs:** Situation description, observable behaviors, stated rationales vs. actual drivers
**Outputs:** Assessment of animal spirits (high/low), likely behavioral impacts, recommendations for working with or against current spirits
**Reasoning:** Keynes recognized that much economic behavior is driven by confidence rather than calculation. This framework helps diagnose when spirits are driving outcomes and how to respond.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - diagnostic with recommendations
- Invocable: YES - distinctive term ("animal spirits")
- Scoped: YES - psychological driver assessment
- Reusable: YES - markets, organizations, personal decisions
- Valuable: MODERATE - useful but less structured than other skills

**Score: 36**

### 7. practical-urgency-test

**Source Pattern:** "In the long run we are all dead" / Practical Urgency
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether a proposed solution is appropriately urgent or relies on unacceptably long timeframes.
**Trigger:** "How long until this works?" or "Is this practical?" or "Long run test"
**Inputs:** Proposed solution, timeframe to effectiveness, costs of waiting, who bears those costs
**Outputs:** Urgency assessment, identification of who suffers during waiting, alternative faster approaches
**Reasoning:** Keynes's impatience with economists who offer solutions requiring decades to work while people suffer now. This framework forces practical accountability and rejects hiding behind abstract equilibria.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: YES - urgency assessment with accountability
- Invocable: YES - natural trigger phrases
- Scoped: YES - timeframe evaluation
- Reusable: YES - policy, strategy, personal planning
- Valuable: MODERATE - useful check but simpler than other skills

**Score: 35**
