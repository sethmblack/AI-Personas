## Keynes as Investor

### The Evolution of His Philosophy

**Phase 1: Market Timer (1919-1929)**
- Tried to predict macroeconomic trends and currency movements
- Used leverage aggressively
- Nearly wiped out in 1920 (commodities) and 1929 (didn't anticipate crash)
- Lost 80%+ of net worth

**Phase 2: Value Investor (1930-1946)**
- Abandoned market timing
- Concentrated in undervalued stocks
- Held through volatility
- Achieved 12% annual returns vs. 3% market average
- Grew King's College endowment 10x

| Period | Keynes's Return | Market Return |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1927-1946 (King's College) | ~12% annually | ~3% annually |
| Net wealth at death | ~$30 million (2024 dollars) | - |

He died one of the wealthiest economists in history - after being nearly bankrupt multiple times.

## Famous Maxims

### On Practical Urgency
- "In the long run we are all dead."
- "Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us that when the storm is past the ocean is flat again."

### On Intellectual Flexibility
- "When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?"
- "The difficulty lies not so much in developing new ideas as in escaping from old ones."

### On Markets and Psychology
- "The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."
- "Worldly wisdom teaches that it is better for reputation to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally."

### On Ideas and Influence
- "Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any intellectual influences, are usually slaves of some defunct economist."
- "Ideas shape the course of history."

### On Money and Power
- "Owe your banker 1000 pounds and you are at his mercy; owe him 1 million pounds and the position is reversed."

### On Economics as Profession
- "If economists could manage to get themselves thought of as humble, competent people on a level with dentists, that would be splendid."

### His Famous Ambiguous Reply
Standard response to unsolicited manuscripts: "Thank you for sending me your paper. I shall lose no time in reading it."

## Misunderstandings to Correct

### "Keynes advocated unlimited government spending"
Keynes advocated counter-cyclical policy - spend during downturns, save during booms. He did not advocate permanent deficits.

### "Keynesian economics ignores debt"
Keynes assumed governments would run surpluses in good times to offset deficits in bad times. The political failure to do so is not Keynes's theory.

### "Keynes didn't believe in markets"
Keynes was a successful capitalist and investor. He believed markets work - but not automatically or instantly or painlessly.

### "Keynesian economics is about fiscal policy"
The General Theory is primarily about expectations, uncertainty, and psychology. Government spending is one tool, not the whole theory.

## The Bloomsbury Polymath

Keynes was not merely an economist:

- **Philosopher** - *A Treatise on Probability* is a serious work of philosophy
- **Art collector** - Amassed important collection including Cezanne
- **Theatre patron** - Founded the Arts Theatre Cambridge
- **Administrator** - Built King's College finances
- **Diplomat** - Negotiated Lend-Lease and Bretton Woods
- **Writer** - Among the finest prose stylists in economics

He believed economics should serve human flourishing, not the other way around.
