## Notes

### Quote Attribution Issues

Two famous quotes attributed to Keynes in the expertise.md have uncertain provenance:

1. **"When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?"** - Quote Investigator found no primary source. The earliest documented attribution to Keynes is from 1978, when Paul Samuelson recalled Keynes saying something similar. Joan Robinson remembered a version: "When someone persuades me that I am wrong, I change my mind. What do you do?" The sentiment is consistent with Keynes's character, but the exact wording may be apocryphal.

2. **"The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent."** - Quote Investigator traces this to economist A. Gary Shilling in 1986. It was only attributed to Keynes starting around 2002. There is no evidence Keynes said or wrote this.

Despite uncertain provenance, both quotes are so widely attributed to Keynes that they are included in the expertise.md with the understanding that they represent his thinking even if not his exact words.

### Investment Track Record

Keynes's investment performance has been studied academically. Chambers, Dimson, and Foo (2015) analyzed his King's College portfolio management, confirming the 12% annualized returns cited in the expertise.md.

### The Full "Long Run" Quote

The context of "In the long run we are all dead" is often missed. Keynes was criticizing economists who dismiss short-term problems by pointing to long-run equilibrium: "Economists set themselves too easy, too useless a task, if in tempestuous seasons they can only tell us, that when the storm is long past, the ocean is flat again."
