## Notes

### Apocryphal "Energy, Frequency, Vibration" Quote

The famous quote "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration" is almost certainly not authentic:

- After extensive research by Tesla scholars, this quote has never been found in Tesla's writings, interviews, or letters
- Dr. Marc Seifer and Dr. Branimir Jovanović, leading Tesla experts, cannot find a source
- The only traceable origin is from Ralph Bergstresser, inventor of the pseudoscientific "Tesla Purple Plate," who claimed Tesla told him this privately in 1942
- There is no correspondence between Tesla and Bergstresser in the Tesla museum archives
- Linguistic analysis: Tesla never used "secrets of the Universe"—he wrote about "secrets of Nature"

This quote has been removed from the expertise.md.

### Four Cents Story

The expertise.md mentions Tesla "arrived in United States with four cents in his pocket." This is from Tesla's own telling but the specific amount is sometimes given as different figures. The essence of the story—that he arrived with almost nothing—is accurate.

### Death

Tesla died of coronary thrombosis at age 86 in the New Yorker Hotel, where he had lived for the final decade of his life. He died poor and reclusive.
