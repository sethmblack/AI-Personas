## Core Technical Contributions

### 1. The Rotating Magnetic Field

Tesla's fundamental insight: multiple phases of alternating current, each reaching peak at different times, can create a magnetic field that appears to rotate. A conductor placed in this rotating field experiences force pulling it along with the rotation—no physical contact or commutator required.

**Why it matters:** This eliminated the problematic commutator and brushes that plagued DC motors, creating self-starting, low-maintenance electric motors that power modern industry.

### 2. Polyphase AC Power System

Tesla conceived not just a motor, but an entire integrated system:
- **Generators:** Convert mechanical energy to electrical
- **Transformers:** Step voltage up for transmission, down for use
- **Transmission lines:** Carry high-voltage AC over long distances efficiently
- **Motors:** Convert electrical energy back to mechanical
- **Lighting:** Incandescent and fluorescent systems

**Why it matters:** DC could only transmit about a mile from the generating station. AC enabled power generation at remote sites (like Niagara Falls) and transmission to cities 26+ miles away—the foundation of the modern power grid.

### 3. The Tesla Coil

A resonant transformer circuit that produces high-voltage, low-current, high-frequency alternating current electricity. Used for wireless transmission experiments and later applications in radio technology, medical equipment, and entertainment.

### 4. Additional Inventions

- Radio technology (disputed with Marconi; Tesla's patents ultimately vindicated)
- Wireless power transmission concepts
- X-ray imaging experimentation
- Remote control (demonstrated radio-controlled boat in 1898)
- Bladeless turbine
- Neon and fluorescent lighting
- Early concepts of radar, robotics, and vertical takeoff aircraft

## Philosophical Framework

### Determinism and Natural Law

Tesla viewed humans as "meat machines" governed by the same physical laws as all matter and energy. He was influenced by Eastern philosophy, particularly through his meeting with Swami Vivekananda in 1896, and used Sanskrit terms like "akasha" and "prana" to describe matter-energy relationships.

### Working for the Future

"The present is theirs; the future, for which I really worked, is mine."

Tesla prioritized long-term scientific contribution over immediate commercial success, often to his financial detriment. He believed the inventor's duty was "to lay the foundation for those who are to come, and point the way."

### Contrast with Edison

| Aspect | Tesla | Edison |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Method | Theory first, then build | Trial and error, many experiments |
| Approach | Visualization, mathematics | Empirical testing |
| Goal | Scientific truth | Commercial viability |
| Work style | Solitary, intense focus | Large laboratory teams |
| Philosophy | "A little practice and a lot of theory" | "A little theory and a lot of practice" |

## The War of the Currents

### DC System (Edison)

- **Advantages:** Safer at low voltages; simpler conceptually
- **Limitations:** Could not be transformed to different voltages; limited to ~1 mile transmission range; required power stations in dense urban areas

### AC System (Tesla/Westinghouse)

- **Advantages:** Easily transformed to high voltage for transmission, low voltage for use; efficient over long distances; simpler motors without commutators
- **Limitations:** Higher voltages more dangerous; required new understanding

### The Battle

Edison waged a propaganda campaign, publicly electrocuting animals with AC to demonstrate its danger. He even secretly backed the development of the AC-powered electric chair to associate alternating current with death.

### Resolution

1893: Westinghouse won contract to illuminate Chicago World's Fair using AC
1896: Niagara Falls hydroelectric plant began operation using Tesla's system
Result: AC became the worldwide standard for power generation and distribution
