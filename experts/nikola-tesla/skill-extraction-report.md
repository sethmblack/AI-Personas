# Nikola Tesla - Skill Extraction Report

## Scoring Criteria

Each skill is evaluated on 5 criteria, each worth up to 10 points (maximum 50 points total):

1. **Distinctiveness** - How unique is this skill to Tesla's methodology?
2. **Actionability** - Can users apply this skill to real problems?
3. **Transferability** - Does the skill work outside Tesla's specific domain?
4. **Teachability** - Can the skill be articulated as a clear process?
5. **Impact** - How significant are the outcomes when applied?

**Priority Levels:**
- **HIGH:** 40+ points - Create standalone skill PROMPT.md
- **MEDIUM:** 30-39 points - Include in persona, no standalone file
- **LOW:** Below 30 points - Reference only

## Skill 1: Mental Prototype Visualization

**Description:** The complete process of conceiving, building, testing, and refining inventions entirely in the mind before any physical construction.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Distinctiveness | 10 | Tesla's signature methodology; no other inventor used this so systematically |
| Actionability | 9 | Clear steps users can practice and apply |
| Transferability | 9 | Applicable to engineering, design, software architecture, any creative field |
| Teachability | 9 | Tesla explicitly described his process in his autobiography |
| Impact | 10 | Eliminates wasted prototyping; dramatically accelerates innovation |

**Total Score: 47/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Trigger Phrases:** "Help me visualize this design," "How would Tesla approach this invention," "Mental prototype"

---

## Skill 2: Systems Integration Analysis

**Description:** Analyzing problems as complete systems rather than isolated components; understanding how every part must work together for the whole to function.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Distinctiveness | 9 | Central to Tesla's approach—conceived entire AC grid, not just motor |
| Actionability | 9 | Users can map systems, identify dependencies, design for integration |
| Transferability | 10 | Universal—software, organizations, products, ecosystems |
| Teachability | 8 | Framework can be articulated; requires practice to master |
| Impact | 9 | Prevents component-level thinking that creates integration failures |

**Total Score: 45/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Trigger Phrases:** "Analyze the complete system," "How do these parts work together," "Systems view"

---

## Skill 3: Rotating Field Problem Reframing

**Description:** The technique of finding breakthrough solutions by questioning fundamental assumptions and approaching problems from unconventional angles—"if everyone knocks on the front door, go around to the back."

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Distinctiveness | 9 | Exemplified by Tesla's stator insight when everyone focused on rotor |
| Actionability | 8 | Can be taught as a questioning framework |
| Transferability | 10 | Universal problem-solving technique |
| Teachability | 8 | Requires examples and practice but can be structured |
| Impact | 10 | Breakthrough innovations come from reframing, not incremental improvement |

**Total Score: 45/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Trigger Phrases:** "I'm stuck on this problem," "What am I missing," "Reframe this challenge"

---

## Skill 4: AC vs DC Decision Framework

**Description:** Choosing between approaches that scale efficiently versus those that don't; identifying which solutions can be "transformed" and transmitted to broader applications.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Distinctiveness | 8 | Derived from Tesla's core insight about AC advantages |
| Actionability | 8 | Clear criteria for evaluation |
| Transferability | 9 | Technology choices, architecture decisions, business models |
| Teachability | 9 | Can be structured as decision matrix |
| Impact | 9 | Fundamental to scalable design |

**Total Score: 43/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

**Trigger Phrases:** "Which approach scales better," "AC or DC this decision," "Will this solution scale"

---

## Skill 5: Incubation and Illumination Process

**Description:** Strategic use of mental incubation periods and optimal conditions (solitude, walks, poetry) to enable breakthrough insights.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Distinctiveness | 7 | Tesla practiced this, but others have described similar processes |
| Actionability | 7 | Somewhat passive—hard to "do" incubation directly |
| Transferability | 9 | Universal to creative work |
| Teachability | 7 | Can describe conditions but illumination isn't controllable |
| Impact | 8 | When it works, produces breakthrough insights |

**Total Score: 38/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Trigger Phrases:** "I need to let this problem incubate," "How do I set up for breakthrough thinking"

---

## Skill 6: Elegance Over Brute Force Evaluation

**Description:** Evaluating solutions by their elegance and theoretical soundness rather than empirical trial-and-error; "a little practice and a lot of theory."

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Distinctiveness | 8 | Tesla's explicit contrast with Edison's approach |
| Actionability | 7 | More of an evaluation lens than active skill |
| Transferability | 8 | Applicable across domains |
| Teachability | 7 | Can articulate criteria but requires judgment |
| Impact | 8 | Produces more maintainable, understandable solutions |

**Total Score: 38/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Trigger Phrases:** "Is this solution elegant," "Am I using brute force"

---

## Skill 7: Future-Oriented Invention Assessment

**Description:** Evaluating ideas based on their contribution to humanity's long-term future rather than immediate market viability.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Distinctiveness | 7 | Tesla's philosophy but shared by other visionaries |
| Actionability | 6 | Philosophical lens more than active skill |
| Transferability | 7 | Useful for research, deep tech, foundational work |
| Teachability | 6 | Hard to teach—more about values than process |
| Impact | 8 | Shapes what problems one chooses to work on |

**Total Score: 34/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Trigger Phrases:** "Is this worth working on," "What matters for the future"

---

## Skill 8: Energy Flow Mapping

**Description:** Analyzing any system by tracing how energy enters, transforms, and exits—revealing inefficiencies and optimization opportunities.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Distinctiveness | 6 | Common in engineering but Tesla applied it broadly |
| Actionability | 8 | Clear process users can follow |
| Transferability | 7 | Best in physical/engineering domains |
| Teachability | 8 | Straightforward methodology |
| Impact | 7 | Useful for optimization but not breakthrough |

**Total Score: 36/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Trigger Phrases:** "Where is energy being wasted," "Map the energy flow"
