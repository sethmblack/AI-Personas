## HIGH Priority

### 1. pain-reflection-progress

**Source Pattern:** Pain + Reflection = Progress (Core Dalio Framework)

**Purpose:** Transform setbacks, failures, and painful experiences into systematic learning and machine improvement by applying Dalio's signature framework.

**Trigger:** "I failed at...", "This went wrong...", "I'm struggling with...", "Help me learn from this mistake", "I made a mistake and...", "I'm devastated by..."

**Inputs:** Description of failure or painful situation; desired outcome that wasn't achieved; relevant context about what happened

**Outputs:** Structured reflection including: acknowledgment of pain, cause-and-effect chain, root cause diagnosis (people vs. machine), principle to create, machine redesign plan, specific next steps

**Reasoning:** This is Dalio's most distinctive and famous framework. It addresses a universal human challenge (processing failure) with a systematic approach that converts emotional reactions into productive analysis. Highly reusable across personal, professional, and organizational contexts. Core to Dalio's identity.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
```
Criterion 1 (Actionable): YES - Clear 5-step process with defined outputs at each stage
Criterion 2 (Invocable): YES - Natural triggers when facing any failure, setback, or pain
Criterion 3 (Scoped): YES - Focused specifically on converting pain to progress
Criterion 4 (Reusable): YES - Applies to any failure in any domain
Criterion 5 (Valuable): YES - Transforms unproductive suffering into systematic growth
Decision: CANDIDATE
```

### 2. five-step-process

**Source Pattern:** The Five-Step Process for Getting What You Want

**Purpose:** Systematically achieve any goal by working through goals, problems, diagnosis, design, and execution in sequence.

**Trigger:** "How do I achieve...", "I'm stuck on...", "Help me plan...", "I have a goal but don't know how to reach it", "I keep failing at..."

**Inputs:** Goal or desired outcome; current situation relative to goal; known obstacles; relevant constraints

**Outputs:** Five-step breakdown: (1) clarified goal with success criteria, (2) identified problems/obstacles, (3) root cause diagnosis for each problem, (4) designed plan to eliminate causes, (5) execution framework with accountability

**Reasoning:** Dalio's core planning methodology that provides rigorous structure preventing common errors (unclear goals, treating symptoms, poor diagnosis, vague plans). Universal applicability to any achievement context.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
```
Criterion 1 (Actionable): YES - Five explicit steps with clear deliverables
Criterion 2 (Invocable): YES - Natural triggers for goal-setting and planning
Criterion 3 (Scoped): YES - Single responsibility (systematic goal achievement)
Criterion 4 (Reusable): YES - Applies to any goal in any domain
Criterion 5 (Valuable): YES - Prevents common planning failures
Decision: CANDIDATE
```

### 3. believability-weighted-decision

**Source Pattern:** Believability-Weighted Decision Making

**Purpose:** Make better group decisions by weighting opinions based on demonstrated competence (track record + reasoning quality) rather than treating all views equally.

**Trigger:** "How should we decide this?", "Everyone has different opinions", "Who should we listen to?", "Help us reach a decision", "The team disagrees about..."

**Inputs:** Decision to be made; stakeholders and their positions; context about each person's relevant experience and track record

**Outputs:** Believability assessment for each stakeholder, weighted synthesis of views, recommended decision with rationale, process for handling remaining disagreement

**Reasoning:** Core Bridgewater methodology addressing universal challenge of synthesizing conflicting opinions. Provides clear criteria (track record + reasoning) that move beyond both autocracy and false democracy.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
```
Criterion 1 (Actionable): YES - Clear assessment criteria and synthesis process
Criterion 2 (Invocable): YES - Natural trigger for group decision scenarios
Criterion 3 (Scoped): YES - Focused on decision synthesis in groups
Criterion 4 (Reusable): YES - Applies to any multi-stakeholder decision
Criterion 5 (Valuable): YES - Addresses pervasive challenge of group decisions
Decision: CANDIDATE
```

### 4. root-cause-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** Root Cause Diagnosis / The Machine Model

**Purpose:** Trace any problem to its root cause by distinguishing symptoms from causes and classifying whether it's a people problem or a machine (process/system) problem.

**Trigger:** "Why does this keep happening?", "What's really causing this?", "Diagnose this problem", "We keep having the same issue", "I fixed it but it came back"

**Inputs:** Description of the problem or symptom; history of occurrence; relevant people and processes involved

**Outputs:** Cause-and-effect chain analysis, classification (people vs. machine problem), root cause identification, principle for addressing root cause

**Reasoning:** Foundational diagnostic skill preventing the common error of treating symptoms while root causes persist. The people-vs-machine distinction is particularly valuable for organizational problems.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
```
Criterion 1 (Actionable): YES - Clear diagnostic process with specific output
Criterion 2 (Invocable): YES - Natural trigger for recurring or persistent problems
Criterion 3 (Scoped): YES - Focused on root cause identification
Criterion 4 (Reusable): YES - Applies to any problem in any domain
Criterion 5 (Valuable): YES - Prevents treating symptoms while causes persist
Decision: CANDIDATE
```

### 5. principle-creation

**Source Pattern:** Creating and Codifying Principles

**Purpose:** Extract reusable decision-making principles from experiences (especially failures), creating a personal or organizational "principle repository" for consistent future decisions.

**Trigger:** "What principle should I create from this?", "How do I avoid this mistake again?", "Help me codify this lesson", "Turn this into a principle", "I want to remember this lesson"

**Inputs:** Experience or situation (especially a failure or difficult decision); the lesson learned; context for future application

**Outputs:** Clearly stated principle in "When X, do Y because Z" format; trigger conditions for when to apply; examples of application; integration guidance with related principles

**Reasoning:** Meta-skill enabling continuous improvement by transforming one-time learning into reusable decision support. Core to Dalio's approach of building a searchable "principle repository."

**Criterion Evaluation:**
```
Criterion 1 (Actionable): YES - Clear format (When X, do Y because Z) and process
Criterion 2 (Invocable): YES - Triggered by learning moments and codification needs
Criterion 3 (Scoped): YES - Single responsibility (principle creation)
Criterion 4 (Reusable): YES - Applies to any learning in any domain
Criterion 5 (Valuable): YES - Enables systematic improvement over time
Decision: CANDIDATE
```

### 6. idea-meritocracy-design

**Source Pattern:** Idea Meritocracy = Radical Truth + Radical Transparency + Believability-Weighted Decision Making

**Purpose:** Design organizational decision-making systems where the best ideas win regardless of who they come from, using radical transparency and believability weighting.

**Trigger:** "How do we make better decisions as a team?", "How do I build a culture of radical transparency?", "Our organization has political dysfunction", "How do we create an idea meritocracy?"

**Inputs:** Description of current organizational decision-making; pain points or dysfunction observed; goals for the culture

**Outputs:** Assessment of current state vs. idea meritocracy; specific transparency practices to implement; believability-weighting mechanisms; implementation roadmap; expected resistance and how to address it

**Reasoning:** Distinctive Bridgewater methodology for organizational design. While more specialized than individual-focused skills, addresses significant organizational dysfunction with systematic approach.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
```
Criterion 1 (Actionable): YES - Clear components and implementation steps
Criterion 2 (Invocable): YES - Triggered by organizational culture questions
Criterion 3 (Scoped): YES - Focused on organizational decision-making design
Criterion 4 (Reusable): YES - Applies to any organization seeking better decisions
Criterion 5 (Valuable): YES - Addresses pervasive organizational dysfunction
Decision: CANDIDATE
```
