## HIGH Priority

### 1. pain-reflection-progress

**Source Pattern:** Pain + Reflection = Progress
**Purpose:** Transform setbacks, failures, and difficulties into systematic learning and improvement by applying Dalio's signature framework.
**Trigger:** "I failed at..." or "This went wrong..." or "I'm struggling with..." or "Help me learn from this mistake"
**Inputs:** Description of failure, setback, or painful situation; desired outcome that wasn't achieved
**Outputs:** Structured reflection including: what happened, root cause diagnosis, principle to create, machine redesign, specific next steps
**Reasoning:** This is Dalio's most famous and distinctive framework. It transforms emotional reactions to failure into systematic improvement. Highly reusable across personal, professional, and organizational contexts. Provides clear structure where most people simply ruminate or avoid.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear 5-step process with defined outputs |
| Invocable | 10 | Natural triggers when facing failure or pain |

### 2. five-step-process

**Source Pattern:** The Five-Step Process
**Purpose:** Systematically achieve any goal by working through goals, problems, diagnosis, design, and execution.
**Trigger:** "How do I achieve..." or "I'm stuck on..." or "Help me plan..." or "I have a goal but don't know how to reach it"
**Inputs:** Goal or desired outcome; current situation; known obstacles
**Outputs:** Five-step breakdown: (1) clarified goal, (2) identified problems/obstacles, (3) root cause diagnosis, (4) designed plan to eliminate causes, (5) execution steps with accountability
**Reasoning:** Dalio's core planning methodology. Provides rigorous structure that prevents common errors (unclear goals, treating symptoms, poor diagnosis). Applicable to any achievement context from personal goals to organizational initiatives.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Five explicit steps with clear outputs |
| Invocable | 10 | Natural triggers for goal-setting and planning |

### 3. believability-weighted-decision

**Source Pattern:** Believability-Weighted Decision Making
**Purpose:** Make better group decisions by weighting opinions based on demonstrated competence rather than treating all views equally.
**Trigger:** "How should we decide this?" or "Everyone has different opinions" or "Who should we listen to?" or "Help us reach a decision"
**Inputs:** Decision to be made; stakeholders and their positions; context about each person's relevant experience
**Outputs:** Believability assessment for each stakeholder, weighted synthesis of views, recommended decision with rationale, process for handling disagreement
**Reasoning:** Core Bridgewater methodology that addresses a universal challenge: how to synthesize conflicting opinions. Provides clear criteria for weighting (track record + logical reasoning), moving beyond both autocracy and false democracy.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear criteria and process, though requires judgment |
| Invocable | 9 | Natural trigger for group decision scenarios |
| Scoped | 9 | Focused on decision synthesis |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to any multi-stakeholder decision |
| Valuable | 10 | Addresses pervasive challenge of group decisions |
| **Total** | **47** | |

### 4. root-cause-diagnosis

**Source Pattern:** Diagnosing Problems / The Machine Model
**Purpose:** Trace any problem to its root cause by distinguishing symptoms from causes and identifying whether it's a people problem or a machine (process/system) problem.
**Trigger:** "Why does this keep happening?" or "What's really causing this?" or "Diagnose this problem" or "We keep having the same issue"
**Inputs:** Description of the problem or symptom; history of occurrence; relevant people and processes involved
**Outputs:** Cause-and-effect chain analysis, classification (people vs. machine problem), root cause identification, principle for addressing root cause
**Reasoning:** Foundational diagnostic skill that prevents treating symptoms while root causes persist. The people-vs-machine distinction is particularly valuable for organizational problems. Enables systematic rather than reactive problem-solving.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear diagnostic process with specific output |
| Invocable | 10 | Natural trigger for recurring or persistent problems |
| Scoped | 9 | Focused on root cause identification |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to any problem in any domain |
| Valuable | 10 | Prevents common error of symptom treatment |
| **Total** | **49** | |

### 5. principle-creation

**Source Pattern:** Creating and Codifying Principles
**Purpose:** Extract reusable decision-making principles from experiences, especially failures, creating a personal or organizational "principle repository."
**Trigger:** "What principle should I create from this?" or "How do I avoid this mistake again?" or "Help me codify this lesson" or "Turn this into a principle"
**Inputs:** Experience or situation (especially a failure or difficult decision); the lesson learned; context for future application
**Outputs:** Clearly stated principle in "When X, do Y because Z" format; trigger conditions for when to apply; examples of application; integration with related principles
**Reasoning:** Meta-skill that enables continuous improvement. Transforms one-time learning into reusable decision support. Addresses the problem of making the same mistakes repeatedly. Core to Dalio's approach of building a "principle repository."

**Criterion Evaluation:**
| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear format and process, some judgment required |
| Invocable | 9 | Triggered by learning moments and codification needs |
| Scoped | 10 | Single responsibility (principle creation) |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to any learning in any domain |
| Valuable | 9 | Enables systematic improvement over time |
| **Total** | **47** | |

### 6. economic-machine-analysis

**Source Pattern:** The Economic Machine Model
**Purpose:** Analyze economic situations through Dalio's transaction-based, debt-cycle framework to understand where we are in cycles and what's likely to happen next.
**Trigger:** "What's happening with the economy?" or "Where are we in the cycle?" or "Explain this economic situation" or "Is this a debt crisis?"
**Inputs:** Economic situation or question; relevant data about debt levels, spending, credit conditions, policy responses
**Outputs:** Analysis covering: transaction dynamics, position in short-term cycle, position in long-term debt cycle, policy lever assessment, likely scenarios
**Reasoning:** Dalio's distinctive economic framework that demystifies complex situations. Provides clear mental model for understanding economies. Particularly valuable for understanding debt crises, policy responses, and cycle positioning.
