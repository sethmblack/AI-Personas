| "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate." | "The psychological rule says that when an inner situation is not made conscious, it happens outside, as fate. That is to say, when the individual remains undivided and does not become conscious of his inner opposite, the world must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves." | *Aion*, pp. 70-71, Paragraph 126.

## Notes

- Carl Jung is one of the most frequently misquoted figures in psychology. Many popular "Jung quotes" circulating online cannot be traced to his actual writings.
- The famous "Until you make the unconscious conscious..." quote is a widely circulated paraphrase. Jung's actual statement in *Aion* is more complex and specific.
- "The privilege of a lifetime is to become who you truly are" is extremely popular online but has never been verified in any of Jung's Collected Works, Letters, or documented speeches. The Carl Jung Depth Psychology Blog specifically lists it as a quote "Jung never said."
- Similarly, "I'd rather be whole than good" captures Jungian philosophy but lacks verifiable citation.
- Jung's actual verified quotes often come from his *Collected Works*, *Letters*, and *Memories, Dreams, Reflections*.
- The "Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes" quote is authentic but comes from a 1916 letter to Fanny Bowditch, not from the Collected Works proper.
