# Carl Jung: Skill Extraction Report

## Extraction Criteria

Each skill is scored on 5 criteria (10 points each, 50 points maximum):

| Criterion | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **Actionable** | Can be performed as a discrete task with clear steps |
| **Invocable** | User can naturally request it with a simple phrase |
| **Scoped** | Has clear boundaries and doesn't sprawl infinitely |
| **Reusable** | Applies to many situations, not just one |
| **Valuable** | Provides significant insight or transformation |

**Priority Thresholds:**
- HIGH: 40-50 points (create skill prompt)
- MEDIUM: 30-39 points (document in expert, may promote later)
- LOW: Below 30 points (keep as expert knowledge only)

## Extracted Skills

### 1. Shadow Work Facilitation

**Description:** Guide users to identify, acknowledge, and integrate shadow material—the rejected, disowned aspects of self that are unconsciously projected onto others.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 10 | Clear steps: identify projection, trace to self, explore origin, integrate |
| Invocable | 10 | "Help me with shadow work" / "Why does X trigger me?" |
| Scoped | 8 | Can expand but has natural structure around specific triggers |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to any interpersonal conflict, recurring reaction, or inner struggle |
| Valuable | 10 | Transformative self-knowledge; addresses root causes of suffering |

**Total: 48/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

---

### 2. Dream Interpretation (Jungian)

**Description:** Interpret dreams using Jung's method—treating dreams as compensatory messages from the unconscious, exploring personal and archetypal symbolism.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Structured approach: amplification, compensation, archetypal analysis |
| Invocable | 10 | "Interpret my dream" / "What does this dream mean?" |
| Scoped | 9 | Clear boundaries around a single dream; can extend to series |
| Reusable | 10 | Everyone dreams; applies to any dream content |
| Valuable | 9 | Provides insight into unconscious dynamics and guidance |

**Total: 47/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

---

### 3. Archetype Identification

**Description:** Identify which archetypal patterns are currently active in a person's life, relationships, or situation.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Can identify archetypes, but "what to do" is less concrete |
| Invocable | 9 | "What archetype am I living?" / "What pattern is this?" |
| Scoped | 7 | Risk of over-application; needs clear limiting frame |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to any life situation, relationship, or phase |
| Valuable | 8 | Illuminating but sometimes abstract; value depends on application |

**Total: 42/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

---

### 4. Psychological Type Analysis

**Description:** Assess psychological type using Jung's original framework—attitudes (introversion/extraversion) and functions (thinking, feeling, sensation, intuition).

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 8 | Can assess type, identify inferior function, explain dynamics |
| Invocable | 9 | "What's my type?" / "Why do we communicate differently?" |
| Scoped | 9 | Clear framework with finite types and functions |
| Reusable | 10 | Applies to self-understanding, relationships, team dynamics |
| Valuable | 8 | Useful for self-awareness; many existing tools already do this |

**Total: 44/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

---

### 5. Individuation Guidance

**Description:** Guide someone through the individuation process—the journey toward psychological wholeness integrating persona, shadow, anima/animus, and Self.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 6 | More of an ongoing orientation than discrete task |
| Invocable | 8 | "Help me with individuation" / "Who am I really?" |
| Scoped | 5 | By nature expansive; covers entire psychological development |
| Reusable | 10 | Universal human journey; applies to everyone |
| Valuable | 10 | Most transformative framework; addresses core human question |

**Total: 39/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

*Note: Too broad for standalone skill; better integrated into expert persona responses and used contextually within other skills.*

---

### 6. Active Imagination Facilitation

**Description:** Guide users through Jung's active imagination technique for dialoguing with unconscious contents.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear steps: relax, focus, allow, dialogue, express, integrate |
| Invocable | 8 | "Guide me through active imagination" / "How do I work with this figure?" |
| Scoped | 8 | Single session focused on specific image or figure |
| Reusable | 9 | Applies to dream figures, moods, creative blocks, complexes |
| Valuable | 8 | Powerful technique but requires user engagement beyond text |

**Total: 42/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

---

### 7. Synchronicity Analysis

**Description:** Analyze meaningful coincidences to discern whether they represent synchronicity and what guidance they may offer.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Can analyze but interpretation is inherently subjective |
| Invocable | 8 | "Is this synchronicity?" / "What does this coincidence mean?" |
| Scoped | 7 | Can be bounded but risks spiraling into magical thinking |
| Reusable | 8 | Applies whenever meaningful coincidences are noticed |
| Valuable | 7 | Valuable when grounded; risks encouraging superstition |

**Total: 37/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

*Note: Better kept as expert knowledge; higher risk of misuse as standalone skill.*

---

### 8. Projection Analysis

**Description:** Help users identify when they are projecting unconscious material onto others and reclaim those projections.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 9 | Clear process: identify charge, trace to self, reclaim |
| Invocable | 9 | "Am I projecting?" / "Why does this bother me so much?" |
| Scoped | 9 | Focused on specific projection instance |
| Reusable | 10 | Universal phenomenon in all relationships |
| Valuable | 9 | Immediately applicable; reduces interpersonal conflict |

**Total: 46/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

*Note: Significant overlap with Shadow Work. Consider merging or making this a subset.*

---

### 9. Complex Identification

**Description:** Identify psychological complexes (mother complex, inferiority complex, etc.) affecting behavior and relationships.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Can identify but working through is long-term therapy |
| Invocable | 7 | "Do I have a mother complex?" / Requires some prior knowledge |
| Scoped | 7 | Bounded by complex but implications spread widely |
| Reusable | 9 | Complexes are universal; applies to many situations |
| Valuable | 8 | Illuminating but may pathologize normal experience |

**Total: 38/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

*Note: Better integrated into expert responses; risk of amateur diagnosis as standalone.*

---

### 10. Midlife Transition Navigation

**Description:** Guide users through midlife transitions using Jungian framework of second-half-of-life development.

| Criterion | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Actionable | 7 | Orientation and framework more than discrete steps |
| Invocable | 8 | "Help me with my midlife crisis" |
| Scoped | 6 | Covers major life transition; inherently broad |
| Reusable | 7 | Applies to specific demographic/life phase |
| Valuable | 9 | Addresses universal developmental challenge |

**Total: 37/50 - MEDIUM PRIORITY**

*Note: Better handled through individuation framework and shadow work skills.*

## Recommended Skill Prompts to Create

1. **shadow-work** - Shadow Work Facilitation (48 pts)
2. **dream-interpretation** - Jungian Dream Interpretation (47 pts)
3. **archetype-identification** - Archetype Pattern Recognition (42 pts)
4. **psychological-type-analysis** - Jungian Type Assessment (44 pts)
5. **active-imagination** - Active Imagination Guidance (42 pts)

*Note: Projection Analysis (46 pts) is merged into Shadow Work as its core mechanism.*

---

## Decision Notes

- **Projection Analysis merged with Shadow Work**: Projection is the primary mechanism through which shadow material becomes visible. Rather than create a separate skill, projection analysis becomes the entry point for shadow work.

- **Individuation kept in expert**: Individuation is Jung's master concept—it's the frame for everything else rather than a discrete skill. It naturally emerges through shadow work, dream interpretation, and archetype identification.

- **Synchronicity kept in expert**: While fascinating, synchronicity analysis as a standalone skill risks encouraging magical thinking or confirmation bias. Better to address synchronicity experiences within the expert persona's broader wisdom.
