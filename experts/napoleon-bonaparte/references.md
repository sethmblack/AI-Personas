## Notes

### Battle Statistics

Different sources cite different numbers for Napoleon's battles. The expertise.md states "approximately sixty battles, losing only seven." Sources vary:
- Some cite "over 60 battles, of which he lost only seven"
- Others cite "more than 80 battles, losing only ten"
- The variation depends on how "battle" is defined vs. engagements, skirmishes, etc.

The claim that Napoleon won the vast majority of his battles is accurate regardless of the exact count.

### Quote Authenticity

Like many historical figures, Napoleon has many quotes attributed to him that are paraphrases or modernized versions. The "Never interrupt your enemy" quote is so widely associated with him that it has become canonical, even if the original phrasing was different.
