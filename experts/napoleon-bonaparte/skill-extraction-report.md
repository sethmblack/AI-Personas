## HIGH Priority

### 1. central-position-strategy

**Source Pattern:** Concentration of Force / The Central Position
**Purpose:** When facing multiple competitors or threats, identify how to position yourself to defeat each in sequence rather than facing all simultaneously.
**Trigger:** "How do I handle multiple competitors?" or "I'm facing threats from several directions" or "Central position analysis"
**Inputs:** Description of multiple opponents/threats, their relationships, your resources and position
**Outputs:** Identification of junction point, sequence of engagement, force allocation, timeline for each phase
**Reasoning:** This is Napoleon's signature strategic innovation - the central position that allowed him to defeat larger coalitions. Highly actionable framework with clear decision criteria. Applicable to business competition, multi-front challenges, resource allocation under constraint.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 10/10 - Clear steps: identify junction, calculate sequence, allocate force, execute
- Invocable: 10/10 - Natural trigger when facing multiple threats
- Scoped: 9/10 - Single responsibility (multi-front strategy), though complex
- Reusable: 10/10 - Applies to business, personal challenges, project management
- Valuable: 10/10 - Prevents fatal error of fighting on all fronts simultaneously

**Total Score: 49/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 2. rapid-tempo-execution

**Source Pattern:** Speed and Mobility / The Forced March
**Purpose:** Accelerate execution to gain initiative and surprise, outpacing competition or circumstances.
**Trigger:** "How can I move faster?" or "I need to outpace the competition" or "Time is critical"
**Inputs:** Current timeline, competitor/circumstance speed, resources available, critical milestones
**Outputs:** Accelerated timeline, what to cut for speed, risks of acceleration, techniques for faster execution
**Reasoning:** Napoleon's emphasis on speed as decisive factor translates directly to modern competition. Framework helps identify what slows execution and how to eliminate it. Prevents over-preparation paralysis.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 10/10 - Produces specific acceleration recommendations
- Invocable: 10/10 - Clear trigger scenarios around speed and timing
- Scoped: 8/10 - Focused on tempo, though touches multiple areas
- Reusable: 10/10 - Applicable to product launches, campaigns, personal goals
- Valuable: 9/10 - Speed advantage is often decisive in competition

**Total Score: 47/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 3. decisive-point-identification

**Source Pattern:** Concentration of Force at Decisive Point
**Purpose:** Identify where to focus limited resources for maximum impact by finding the one point where victory matters most.
**Trigger:** "Where should I focus?" or "What's the decisive point?" or "I have limited resources"
**Inputs:** Description of situation, available resources, possible targets/goals, constraints
**Outputs:** Identification of decisive point, rationale, resource allocation recommendation, what to sacrifice or deprioritize
**Reasoning:** Core Napoleonic principle of mass at the decisive point. Prevents dispersion of effort across too many objectives. Creates clear prioritization framework.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 10/10 - Produces specific focus recommendation with rationale
- Invocable: 10/10 - Natural trigger when overwhelmed or under-resourced
- Scoped: 9/10 - Single decision (where to focus) with supporting analysis
- Reusable: 10/10 - Strategy, career, product development, any prioritization
- Valuable: 10/10 - Focus is perhaps the highest-leverage decision

**Total Score: 49/50 - HIGH PRIORITY**

### 4. troop-inspiration

**Source Pattern:** The Moral Factor / Communication and Motivation
**Purpose:** Craft communications that inspire extraordinary effort from teams facing difficult challenges.
**Trigger:** "How do I motivate my team?" or "We're facing long odds" or "Craft an inspiring message"
**Inputs:** Situation description, audience, current morale challenges, desired action
**Outputs:** Structured motivational communication addressing hardship, glory, significance, and call to action
**Reasoning:** Napoleon's proclamations transformed demoralized armies into conquering forces. The framework (acknowledge hardship, promise reward, invoke significance, call to action) is replicable and powerful.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 10/10 - Produces complete motivational communication
- Invocable: 9/10 - Clear trigger around morale and motivation challenges
- Scoped: 9/10 - Focused on inspirational communication
- Reusable: 10/10 - Teams, organizations, campaigns, movements

### 5. corps-system-design

**Source Pattern:** The Corps System
**Purpose:** Design organizational structures that balance autonomy with coordination, allowing parallel action and rapid concentration.
**Trigger:** "How should I structure my organization?" or "I need flexibility and coordination" or "Design a corps system"
**Inputs:** Organization size, objectives, need for autonomy vs. coordination, resource constraints
**Outputs:** Proposed structure with self-sufficient units, coordination mechanisms, flexibility provisions
**Reasoning:** Napoleon's corps system was a revolutionary organizational innovation. The principle of self-sufficient units that can act independently yet combine rapidly applies to modern organizations facing complex, dynamic environments.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 9/10 - Produces organizational design recommendations
- Invocable: 8/10 - Trigger around organizational structure questions
- Scoped: 8/10 - Organizational design is broad but principle is specific
- Reusable: 9/10 - Companies, teams, projects, distributed organizations

## MEDIUM Priority

### 6. calculated-audacity-assessment

**Source Pattern:** The Calculated Audacity
**Purpose:** Evaluate whether a bold move is warranted vs. conventional approach, balancing risk with potential reward.

**Inputs:** Proposed bold action, conventional alternative, risk factors, potential rewards, opponent expectations
**Outputs:** Recommendation (bold or conventional), risk-reward analysis, conditions that favor audacity, execution requirements
**Reasoning:** Napoleon's boldness was calculated, not reckless. Framework helps distinguish warranted audacity from foolish risk-taking. Prevents both excessive caution and unjustified gambles.

**Criterion Evaluation:**
- Actionable: 8/10 - Produces go/no-go recommendation with analysis
- Invocable: 8/10 - Triggered by major decision points involving risk
- Scoped: 8/10 - Risk assessment is specific but touches many factors
