# Thomas Aquinas

> "Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it."

**Thomas Aquinas** (1225-1274) was a Dominican friar, philosopher, and theologian who became the most influential systematic thinker in the history of Catholic Christianity. Born to Italian nobility, he disappointed his family by joining the mendicant Dominicans rather than pursuing a prestigious Benedictine career. After studying under Albertus Magnus in Paris and Cologne, he became the preeminent theologian of the medieval world, producing over eight million words of systematic philosophy and theology.

Aquinas is best known for the *Summa Theologiae*, an encyclopedic treatment of Christian doctrine that harmonized Aristotelian philosophy with Christian revelation. His synthesis demonstrated that faith and reason are complementary paths to truth — that loving God with all one's mind includes rigorous philosophical inquiry.

## The Grand Synthesis: Faith and Reason

The 13th century presented Christian thinkers with a crisis. Aristotle's philosophical works, newly recovered through Arabic translations, offered powerful tools for understanding reality — but these tools came from a pagan thinker who knew nothing of Christ. Many feared that embracing Aristotle would undermine faith.

Aquinas saw the matter differently. If God is the source of all truth, then truth discovered through reason cannot contradict truth revealed through faith. The two are like "two wings" by which the mind rises to contemplation of truth.

He distinguished between **preambles of faith** — truths that can be demonstrated by reason alone (such as God's existence and unity) — and **articles of faith** — truths that exceed reason and require revelation (such as the Trinity and Incarnation). The articles of faith are not *contrary* to reason but *above* it. A truth that genuinely contradicted reason could not be from God.

This principle — "grace does not destroy nature but perfects it" — became the foundation of Catholic intellectual life. Science, philosophy, and theology each have their proper domains. They illuminate rather than threaten each other.

## The Five Ways: Demonstrating God's Existence

In the *Summa Theologiae*, Aquinas presents five arguments for God's existence, not as proofs that compel assent but as "ways" that reason can travel to reach the conclusion that God exists.

### The First Way: Motion

Everything that moves is moved by something else. But an infinite regress of movers is impossible — there must be a First Mover that initiates all motion without being moved itself. This we call God.

### The Second Way: Efficient Causation

Every effect has a cause. Nothing can be its own efficient cause. An infinite regress of causes is impossible, so there must be a First Cause. This we call God.

### The Third Way: Contingency

We observe things that can exist or not exist — contingent beings. If everything were merely contingent, at some time nothing would have existed. But something exists now. Therefore, there must be a Necessary Being whose existence is not contingent on anything else. This we call God.

### The Fourth Way: Gradation

Things exhibit degrees of perfection — more or less good, more or less true. Degrees presuppose a maximum that causes lesser degrees. There must be a supremely perfect being. This we call God.

### The Fifth Way: Teleology

Natural bodies act toward ends even without knowledge. What lacks knowledge cannot move toward an end unless directed by intelligence. Therefore, there exists an Intelligence directing all things to their ends. This we call God.

These arguments do not compete with scientific explanations. Science explains *how* things work within nature. The Five Ways ask why there is *anything* for science to study — why there is existence rather than nothing, order rather than chaos.

## Natural Law: Ethics from Reason

Aquinas's natural law theory provides a rational foundation for ethics independent of (though complementary to) divine revelation.

**Eternal law** is God's rational governance of all creation — the divine plan by which the universe is ordered.

**Natural law** is the rational creature's participation in eternal law. Because humans have reason, we can discern the fundamental principles of morality through reflection on our nature. The most basic precept is: *"Good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided."*

From this first principle flow secondary precepts: preserve human life, reproduce and educate offspring, seek truth, live in society. These are not arbitrary commands but reflect what truly fulfills rational nature.

**Human law** consists of particular determinations of natural law for specific communities. Laws against murder are direct applications of the natural law precept to preserve life. Traffic regulations are more remote determinations that serve social order.

Crucially, human laws that contradict natural law are not truly laws. An unjust law is "not law but a perversion of law." This principle influenced later thinkers from John Locke to Martin Luther King Jr., who cited Aquinas in his "Letter from Birmingham Jail."

## The Virtues: Character Formation

Aquinas integrated Aristotelian virtue ethics with Christian teaching, creating a comprehensive framework for moral development.

### The Cardinal Virtues

Four "hinge" virtues (from Latin *cardo*, meaning hinge) on which all others turn:

**Prudence** is right reason in action — knowing what to do in particular circumstances. It is the "charioteer" of the virtues, directing all others.

**Justice** is rendering to each their due — maintaining right relationships with others.

**Fortitude** is courage in pursuing good despite difficulty, danger, or fear.

**Temperance** is moderation in pleasures — not being ruled by appetites.

These virtues can be acquired through practice. They are "natural" virtues in that they perfect our natural capacities.

### The Theological Virtues

Three virtues that exceed natural capacity and must be infused by grace:

**Faith** is assent to divine truth on God's authority.

**Hope** is confident expectation of eternal life and the means to attain it.

**Charity** is love of God for His own sake and love of neighbor for God's sake.

Charity is the "form" of all virtues — the virtue that orders all others to their proper end. Without charity, even natural virtues lack their final perfection.

## Just War: The Ethics of Violence

Aquinas's just war theory provides rigorous criteria for evaluating military action. Three conditions must all be met:

**1. Legitimate Authority:** War must be declared by the proper sovereign power, not private individuals. Only those responsible for the common good may authorize the use of force.

**2. Just Cause:** Those attacked must deserve it on account of some fault. Augustine, whom Aquinas quotes, defines just war as one that "avenges wrongs" — when a nation refuses to make amends for injuries or restore what was unjustly seized.

**3. Right Intention:** The aim must be advancing good or avoiding evil, not aggrandizement, cruelty, or lust for domination. Even with legitimate authority and just cause, a war waged with wicked intention is unjust.

Additional constraints include: violence as last resort, proportionality between goods achieved and harms caused, and protection of non-combatants. The doctrine of double effect — that one may tolerate evil side effects of good actions without intending them — emerged from this analysis.

## Essence and Existence: The Metaphysical Foundation

At the heart of Aquinas's philosophy lies a profound metaphysical insight: the distinction between essence and existence.

**Essence** is *what* a thing is — its nature, definition, or quiddity. A human being's essence includes rationality, animality, and other defining characteristics.

**Existence** is *that* a thing is — the act of being by which an essence is actualized.

In every creature, essence and existence are really distinct. A triangle's essence (three-sided figure) does not include existence — triangles could fail to exist. Creatures receive their existence from without.

Only in God are essence and existence identical. God does not merely *have* existence; God *is* existence itself — *Ipsum Esse Subsistens*, Subsistent Being Itself. This is why God cannot not exist, why God is absolutely simple (having no composition), and why all other beings depend on God for their very existence.

This insight transforms the Five Ways from mere logical arguments to profound metaphysical demonstrations. The First Mover, First Cause, and Necessary Being are not simply the first item in a series but the ground of all existence — Being itself from which all beings flow.

## "All That I Have Written Seems Like Straw"

In December 1273, while saying Mass in Naples, Thomas experienced something that changed him. He stopped writing entirely. When his companion Reginald urged him to continue his work, Thomas replied:

> "All that I have written seems like straw to me compared to what I have seen and what has been revealed to me."

He never wrote again. Three months later, he died at Fossanova Abbey while traveling to the Council of Lyon. He was 49 years old. The *Summa Theologiae* remained unfinished.

What did Thomas see? He never said. But his silence speaks volumes about the limits even of the greatest systematic theology. Philosophy and theology can point toward God, demonstrate truths about God, order our thinking about God — but they cannot substitute for direct encounter with the divine.

The man who spent his life showing that reason serves faith ended by showing that both serve a reality beyond words.
