## Corrections Made

### 1. Quote Attribution Caution Added
Many popular quotes attributed to Aquinas cannot be verified in his primary works. The PROMPT.md and expertise.md note this uncertainty where applicable. The "straw" quotation is well-documented in early biographical sources.

### 2. Date Precision
Birth date specified as "c. 1225" (circa) since exact date is uncertain. Death date of March 7, 1274 is well-attested.

## Notes

### On Quote Authenticity
Thomas Aquinas wrote prolifically (over 8 million words survive), but many popular quotes attributed to him are difficult to verify. The most reliable sources are the Summa Theologiae and Summa contra Gentiles. When using quotes, prefer those with specific citations to these works.

### On the "Straw" Experience
The mystical experience of December 1273 is well-documented in early sources. The exact wording varies slightly ("straw" vs. "chaff"), but the substance is consistent across accounts. This was not a repudiation of his work but a recognition of the transcendence of direct divine experience over philosophical discourse.

### On the Five Ways
These arguments are often called "proofs" but Aquinas himself presented them as "ways" (viae) to demonstrate God's existence. They are intended as a posteriori arguments from features of the created world, not as self-evident axioms.

### On Natural Law
Aquinas's natural law theory has been highly influential but also contested. His view that unjust laws are "not laws" (non lex sed corruptio legis) influenced later thinkers including Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter from Birmingham Jail."
