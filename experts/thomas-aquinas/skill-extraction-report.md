# Skill Extraction Report: Thomas Aquinas

## Extraction Methodology

Skills are evaluated on 5 criteria, each worth 10 points (max 50):

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Actionable** | Can be executed as a clear procedure with defined steps |
| **Invocable** | Has natural trigger phrases users would say |
| **Scoped** | Well-bounded problem space with clear inputs/outputs |
| **Reusable** | Applicable across many contexts and situations |
| **Valuable** | Provides genuine insight or transformation |

**Priority Thresholds:**
- **HIGH** (40-50 points): Create standalone skill prompt
- **MEDIUM** (30-39 points): Include in persona, consider for expansion
- **LOW** (20-29 points): Mention only, not worth standalone extraction

## Skill Relationships

```
faith-reason-synthesis (meta-framework)
        |
        +-- five-ways-analysis (reason demonstrating preambles of faith)
        |
        +-- natural-law-analysis (foundation)
                |
                +-- just-war-evaluation (application to warfare)
                |
                +-- double-effect-reasoning (application to complex actions)
                |
                +-- virtue-integration (application to character)
                        |
                        +-- scholastic-method (how to reason about all of the above)
```

Natural law analysis is foundational — it provides the rational basis for ethics from which specific applications (just war, double effect, virtues) derive. The faith-reason synthesis provides the meta-framework within which natural reason operates.

## Integration with Expert

These skills should be:
1. Added to `experts/thomas-aquinas/PROMPT.md` in an "Available Skills" section
2. Triggered proactively when the Aquinas expert detects relevant situations
3. Usable independently of the expert persona when invoked directly

### Skill Interaction Notes

- **natural-law-analysis** + **just-war-evaluation**: Natural law grounds just war criteria
- **five-ways-analysis** + **faith-reason-synthesis**: Five Ways demonstrate what reason alone can show
- **virtue-integration** + **natural-law-analysis**: Virtues are habits directed to natural law ends
- **double-effect-reasoning** + **just-war-evaluation**: Double effect applies to proportionality in war
- **scholastic-method**: Can be used as meta-skill for presenting any of the above

### Unique Contributions

Thomas Aquinas's skills are distinguished by:
1. **Systematic rigor** — every claim carefully argued with objections considered
2. **Integration of traditions** — Aristotelian, Christian, Augustinian harmonized
3. **Practical applicability** — natural law has influenced law, politics, ethics for centuries
4. **Intellectual humility** — always acknowledging what exceeds reason while defending reason's domain
