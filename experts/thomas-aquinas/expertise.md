## Core Philosophical Concepts

### 1. The Five Ways (Quinque Viae)

Five arguments for God's existence from Summa Theologiae I, Q2, A3:

**First Way: Motion (The Unmoved Mover)**
- Whatever is moved is moved by another
- Cannot regress infinitely in movers
- Therefore, there must be a First Mover, unmoved: God

**Second Way: Efficient Causation (The First Cause)**
- Every effect has an efficient cause
- Nothing can be its own efficient cause
- Cannot regress infinitely in causes
- Therefore, there must be a First Efficient Cause: God

**Third Way: Contingency (Necessary Being)**
- Contingent beings can exist or not exist
- If everything were merely possible, at some time nothing would exist
- But something exists now, so not everything is merely possible
- Therefore, there must be a Necessary Being: God

**Fourth Way: Gradation (Degrees of Perfection)**
- Things exhibit degrees of goodness, truth, nobility
- Degrees presuppose a maximum that causes all lesser degrees
- Therefore, there exists a supreme perfection: God

**Fifth Way: Teleology (Intelligent Designer)**
- Natural bodies act toward ends even without knowledge
- What lacks knowledge cannot move toward an end unless directed
- Therefore, there exists an intelligence directing all things: God

### 2. Faith and Reason

The harmonization of faith (fides) and reason (ratio):

**Two Sources of Truth:**
- Natural reason: what can be known through observation and argument
- Divine revelation: what is known through Scripture and tradition

**Preambles of Faith:**
- Truths knowable by reason alone (God's existence, unity, etc.)
- Philosophy can demonstrate these independently

**Articles of Faith:**
- Truths exceeding reason (Trinity, Incarnation, etc.)
- Known only through revelation
- Not contrary to reason, but above reason

**Principle:** "Grace does not destroy nature but perfects it"
- Faith and reason cannot truly contradict
- Both derive from God as source of truth
- Philosophy serves as handmaid to theology

### 3. Essence and Existence

Fundamental metaphysical distinction:

**Essence (Essentia):** What a thing is; its nature or quiddity
**Existence (Esse):** That a thing is; the act of being

**Key Insights:**
- In creatures, essence and existence are really distinct
- Essence is potential; existence actualizes it
- In God alone, essence and existence are identical
- God is Ipsum Esse Subsistens (Subsistent Being Itself)
- This grounds divine simplicity and all divine attributes

### 4. Natural Law Theory

Foundation of Thomistic ethics:

**Eternal Law:** God's rational governance of all creation

**Natural Law:** Rational creature's participation in eternal law
- Knowable through reason
- Universal and unchangeable in first principles
- Primary precept: "Good is to be done and pursued, evil avoided"

**Human Law:** Determinations of natural law for particular communities
- Must be derived from natural law
- Unjust laws are not truly laws ("a perversion of law")

**Divine Law:** Revealed law in Scripture (Old Law and New Law)

### 5. Virtue Ethics

Integration of Aristotelian and Christian virtue:

**Cardinal Virtues (Natural/Acquired):**
- Prudence (prudentia): right reason in action
- Justice (iustitia): rendering to each their due
- Fortitude (fortitudo): courage in pursuing good
- Temperance (temperantia): moderation in pleasures

**Theological Virtues (Supernatural/Infused):**
- Faith: assent to divine truth
- Hope: confident expectation of eternal life
- Charity: love of God and neighbor for God's sake

**Infused Moral Virtues:**
- Supernatural counterparts of cardinal virtues
- Necessary for acts meriting eternal life

### 6. Analogy of Being

How we speak meaningfully about God:

**Univocal:** Same meaning in all uses (rejected for God)
**Equivocal:** Completely different meanings (rejected)
**Analogical:** Related but proportionally different meanings

When we say "God is good" and "humans are good":
- Not identical in meaning
- Not totally different
- Analogically related through participation

### 7. Divine Simplicity

God has no composition of any kind:
- No matter/form composition
- No essence/existence composition
- No genus/species composition
- No substance/accident composition
- All divine attributes are identical with the divine essence
- God is pure act (actus purus) with no potentiality

### 8. Just War Theory

Three conditions for a just war (Summa Theologiae II-II, Q40):

1. **Legitimate Authority:** Declared by proper sovereign
2. **Just Cause:** Those attacked must deserve it for some fault
3. **Right Intention:** Aim at advancing good or avoiding evil

Additional principles:
- Last resort
- Proportionality
- Non-combatant immunity (from double-effect reasoning)

## Famous Quotations

### Verified from Primary Works

From the Summa Theologiae:
> "Good is to be done and pursued, and evil is to be avoided." (ST I-II, Q94, A2)

> "To one who has faith, no explanation is necessary. To one without faith, no explanation is possible." (attributed, widespread)

> "The things that we love tell us what we are."

> "There is nothing on this earth more to be prized than true friendship."

### The Mystical Experience (December 1273)
> "All that I have written seems like straw to me compared to what I have seen and what has been revealed to me."

### Response to Christ
When Christ reportedly asked "You have written well of me, Thomas. What would you have as your reward?"
> "Nothing but You, Lord."

### On Faith and Reason
> "Faith has to do with things that are not seen and hope with things that are not at hand."

> "The truth of our faith becomes a matter of ridicule among the infidels if any Catholic, not gifted with the necessary scientific learning, presents as dogma what scientific scrutiny shows to be false."

## Contrast with Other Thinkers

### Aquinas vs. Augustine

- Augustine: Platonic influence; divine illumination; emphasis on will
- Aquinas: Aristotelian influence; abstraction from sense experience; emphasis on intellect
- Both: primacy of grace; original sin; need for revelation

- Aquinas: creation ex nihilo; personal God; immortal soul
- Aristotle: eternal world; impersonal unmoved mover; uncertain on personal immortality
- Aquinas transforms Aristotle through the essence/existence distinction

### Aquinas vs. Duns Scotus

- Aquinas: analogy of being; real distinction of essence/existence
- Scotus: univocity of being; formal distinction
- Both: scholastic method; importance of philosophy for theology
